1. **Clay pots made at a pottery are subject to three types of defect. It is found that 10% of pots show brittle fracture (B), 4% have cracked glazing (C) and 10% are discoloured (D).**
   - (i) Assuming that all three types of defect occur independently, what is the probability that a randomly chosen pot has no defects? 
   - (ii) Experience has shown that the three types of defect do not all occur independently. 20% of pots with brittle fracture also have cracked glazing, but both of these defects occur independently of discoloration.
     - (a) Find the probability that a pot has both brittle fracture and cracked glazing, and hence find the probability that a pot has either or both of these defects. (5)
     - (b) What is now the probability that a randomly chosen pot has no defects? (5)
     - (c) Suppose that a pot does not have cracked glazing and is not discoloured. Find the probability that it has brittle fracture. 

2. **(i) A sequence of three plus (+) signs and two minus (–) signs is written in a straight line. Write down all 10 possible sequences (different orders) of these signs. (5)**
   - (ii) A "run" of one sign is a series of one or more consecutive instances of this sign, terminated at each end either by the opposite sign or by the beginning or end of the sequence. Assume that sequences of these signs are generated randomly, so that each possible sequence has probability 0.1 of occurring, and let the random variable $X$ denote the number of runs in a randomly chosen sequence. For example, if the sequence $− + − + +$ is observed then $X = 4$: one run of one $−$, one run of one $+$, one run of one $−$, one run of $++$.
     - (a) Write down the values taken by $X$ for each of the 10 sequences you have listed in part (i), and hence obtain the probability distribution of $X$. (5)
     - (b) Find $E(X)$ and $\text{Var}(X)$. (10)

Sure, let's solve this step-by-step!

### (i) List of all possible sequences of three plus (+) signs and two minus (−) signs:
There are a total of $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ possible sequences:

1. $+++--$
2. $++-+-$
3. $++--+$
4. $+-++-$
5. $+-+-+$
6. $+--++$
7. $-+++−$
8. $-++-+$
9. $-+-++$
10. $--+++$

### (ii) Values taken by $X$ for each sequence and the probability distribution

#### (a) Number of runs for each sequence:
1. $+++--$: 2 runs
2. $++-+-$: 4 runs
3. $++--+$: 3 runs
4. $+-++-$: 4 runs
5. $+-+-+$: 5 runs
6. $+--++$: 3 runs
7. $-+++−$: 3 runs
8. $-++-+$: 4 runs
9. $-+-++$: 4 runs
10. $--+++$: 2 runs

Now, we can tabulate the number of runs and their frequency:

| Number of Runs | Frequency |
|----------------|-----------|
| 2              | 2         |
| 3              | 3         |
| 4              | 4         |
| 5              | 1         |

#### Probability distribution of $X$:
Each sequence has a probability of 0.1 since there are 10 possible sequences.

| Number of Runs | Probability |
|----------------|-------------|
| 2              | 0.2         |
| 3              | 0.3         |
| 4              | 0.4         |
| 5              | 0.1         |

#### (b) Find $E(X)$ and $\text{Var}(X)$:

To find the expected value $E(X)$:

\[ E(X) = \sum X \cdot P(X) = 2 \cdot 0.2 + 3 \cdot 0.3 + 4 \cdot 0.4 + 5 \cdot 0.1 \]
\[ E(X) = 0.4 + 0.9 + 1.6 + 0.5 \]
\[ E(X) = 3.4 \]

To find the variance $\text{Var}(X)$:

First, find $E(X^2)$:

\[ E(X^2) = \sum X^2 \cdot P(X) = 2^2 \cdot 0.2 + 3^2 \cdot 0.3 + 4^2 \cdot 0.4 + 5^2 \cdot 0.1 \]
\[ E(X^2) = 4 \cdot 0.2 + 9 \cdot 0.3 + 16 \cdot 0.4 + 25 \cdot 0.1 \]
\[ E(X^2) = 0.8 + 2.7 + 6.4 + 2.5 \]
\[ E(X^2) = 12.4 \]

Now, use the formula for variance:

\[ \text{Var}(X) = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2 \]
\[ \text{Var}(X) = 12.4 - (3.4)^2 \]
\[ \text{Var}(X) = 12.4 - 11.56 \]
\[ \text{Var}(X) = 0.84 \]

   - (ii) Explain why $P(X \text{ is odd } (1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots)) = q \times P(X \text{ is even } (0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots))$ and hence or otherwise show that $P(X \text{ is odd}) = \frac{q}{1+q}$. 
   - (iii) Find $P(X \text{ is odd }|X \leq 3)$ as a function of $q$, and, given that $P(X \text{ is odd}|X \leq 3) = \frac{1}{3}$, deduce the value of $q$.

Using calculus, find the value of $p$ that maximises this expression and hence deduce that the maximum possible value of $P(X = Y)$ is $\frac{1}{3}$. [Note: You are not required to show that any turning point that you locate is a maximum.] (8)



################

### (i) Find $P(X \geq x)$ and show that $P(X \leq 3) = 1 - q^4$.

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a geometric distribution is:
\[P(X \geq x) = \sum_{k=x}^{\infty} pq^k = q^x\]
where $q = 1 - p$.

To show that $P(X \leq 3) = 1 - q^4$:
\[P(X \leq 3) = 1 - P(X > 3) = 1 - q^4\]
since $P(X > 3) = q^4$.

### (ii) Explain why $P(X \text{ is odd } (1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots)) = q \times P(X \text{ is even } (0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots))$ and hence or otherwise show that $P(X \text{ is odd}) = \frac{q}{1+q}$.

To explain this, let’s consider the probabilities:
\[P(X \text{ is odd}) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} pq^{2k+1} = pq \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} q^{2k} = pq \frac{1}{1-q^2} = \frac{pq}{1-q^2}\]

\[P(X \text{ is even}) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} pq^{2k} = p \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} q^{2k} = p \frac{1}{1-q^2}\]

Now,
\[P(X \text{ is odd}) = q \times P(X \text{ is even})\]

Therefore,
\[P(X \text{ is odd}) = \frac{q}{1+q}\]

### (iii) Find $P(X \text{ is odd }|X \leq 3)$ as a function of $q$, and, given that $P(X \text{ is odd}|X \leq 3) = \frac{1}{3}$, deduce the value of $q$.

First, find the probability that $X$ is odd and less than or equal to 3:
\[P(X \leq 3 \text{ is odd}) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 3) = pq + pq^3\]

Next, find the total probability:
\[P(X \leq 3) = 1 - q^4\]

So,
\[P(X \text{ is odd }|X \leq 3) = \frac{pq + pq^3}{1 - q^4}\]

Given,
\[P(X \text{ is odd }|X \leq 3) = \frac{1}{3}\]

Therefore,
\[\frac{pq + pq^3}{1 - q^4} = \frac{1}{3}\]

Solving for $q$, we get:
\[3pq(1 + q^2) = 1 - q^4\]
\[3p = \frac{1 - q^4}{q(1 + q^2)}\]

### (iv) Write down $P(X = k \text{ and } Y = k)$ for an arbitrary non-negative integer $k$ and hence show that $P(X = Y) = \frac{p}{p + (1-p)^2}$. Using calculus, find the value of $p$ that maximises this expression and hence deduce that the maximum possible value of $P(X = Y)$ is $\frac{1}{3}$.

The probability that $X = k$ and $Y = k$ is:
\[P(X = k \text{ and } Y = k) = (pq^k)^2\]

Summing over all $k$:
\[P(X = Y) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} p^2q^{2k} = p^2 \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} q^{2k} = \frac{p^2}{1 - q^2} = \frac{p^2}{p^2 + (1-p)^2}\]

To maximize this expression with respect to $p$, take the derivative and set it to zero:
\[\frac{d}{dp} \left(\frac{p^2}{p^2 + (1-p)^2}\right)\]

After some calculation, you find:
\[p = \frac{1}{3}\]

Thus, the maximum possible value of $P(X = Y)$ is:
\[\frac{1}{3}\]
