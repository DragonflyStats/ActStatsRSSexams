A survey is undertaken to investigate the frequency of motor accidents at a certain intersection.
It is assumed that, independently for each week, the number of accidents follows a Poisson distribution with mean λ.
(i)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
8
In a single week of observation two accidents occur. Determine a 95\% confidence interval for λ, using tables of “Probabilities for the Poisson distribution”.

(ii) In an observation period of 30 weeks an average of 2.4 accidents is recorded.
Determine a 95\% confidence interval for λ, using a normal approximation. 
(iii) Comment on your answers in parts (i) and (ii) above.

A random sample of 25 recent claim amounts in a general insurance context is taken from a population that you may assume is normally distributed. In units of £1,000, the sample mean is x = 9.416 and the sample standard deviation is s = 2.105.
Calculate a 95\% one-sided upper confidence limit (that is, the upper limit k of a confidence interval of the form (0,k)) for the standard deviation of the claim amounts in the population.

(i)
For a single observation x from Poisson( λ ) a 95% confidence interval for λ is
( λ 1 , λ 2 ) where
∞
∑ p ( r ; λ 1 ) = 0.025
x
and
r = x
∑ p ( r ; λ 2 ) = 0.025
r = 0
So for x = 2
λ 1 is s.t.
∞
∑ p ( r ; λ 1 ) = 0.025
r = 2
1
i.e.
∑ p ( r ; λ 1 ) = 0.975
r = 0
From tables λ 1 is between 0.20 and 0.30 being about 0.24.
λ 2 is s.t.
2
∑ p ( r ; λ 2 ) = 0.025
r = 0
From tables λ 2 is between 7.00 and 7.25 being about 7.23.
95% confidence interval for λ is $(0.24, 7.23)$.

(ii)
For a sample of n with observed mean x
X −λ
≈ N (0,1)
ˆ λ
where λ ˆ = X
[OR: could use
Σ X − n λ
≈ N (0,1) ]
ˆ
n λ
n
giving an approximate 95% confidence interval as X ± 1.96
X
n
So for n = 30, x =2.4
95% CI is 2.4 ± 1.96
(iii)
2.4
⇒ 2.4 ± 0.55 ⇒ (1.85, 2.95)
30
The CI in (ii) is much narrower due to having more data.
(It is also centred higher due to the larger estimate.)

Let σ 2 be the population variance.

⇒ P ⎜ σ <

⇒ k = 2.771 so upper confidence limit for σ is 2.771 i.e. £2771
(OR: CI is (0, 2.771) i.e. (0, £2771)).
