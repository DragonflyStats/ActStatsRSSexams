A statistician has a series of bivariate data {(x 1 ,y 1 ), (x 2 ,y 2 ), ... (x n ,y n )} and wishes to
perform a linear regression on these data.
(i) State the equation that must be minimised to give the least squares estimates of
coefficients.

(ii) Derive the least squares estimate of the slope coefficient from the equation in
(i).

For a sample of 44 fish, the age (days) and length (millimetres) of each fish are
measured. Denote age by X and length by Y. The following summary data are
obtained:
3,660, \sum x x i i 2 2 = 389,684,
389,684, \sum y y i i = 136,727,

(ii) Partially differentiate w.r.t. each parameter and equate to zero gives:
2 \sum nnii=1 [yy ii − (\hat{\alpha}+ \hat{\beta}xx ii )] = 0 ⇒ \sum nnii=1 yy ii = nn\hat{\alpha}+ \hat{\beta}\sum nnii=1 xx ii

2 \sum nnii=1 xx ii [yy ii − (\hat{\alpha}+ \hat{\beta}xx ii )] = 0 ⇒ \sum nnii=1 xx ii yy ii = \hat{\alpha}\sum nnii=1 xx ii + \hat{\beta}\sum nnii=1 xx ii2
Eliminate \hat{\alpha}from simultaneous equations:
