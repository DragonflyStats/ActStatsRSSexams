Consider the following data, and the corresponding sums derived from the data:
x i :10.0 6.9 11.4 12.6 10.3 12.4 9.8
∑ x i = 73.4; ∑ x i 2 = 792.22; ∑ x i 3 = 8,750.972.
(i) Determine the third moment about the mean for these data.

(ii) (a) Write down the mathematical definition of the coefficient of skewness
of a set of data.

This question was very well answered by most candidates. In part (ii), a
common mistake was using n instead of n-1 in the denominator.

Answers in part (i) were mixed, with many candidates struggling with
the formula and failing to arrive at the correct answer. Parts (ii) and
(iii) were answered well. Some candidates used n instead of n-1 in the
formula for the variance.
