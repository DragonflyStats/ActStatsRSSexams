An analyst wishes to model the number of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) on the
local stock exchange each calendar month. Let X i be a random variable denoting the
number of IPOs in month i, where all X i ’s are independent. The analyst wishes to
model X i using a Poisson distribution but is aware that there is less activity during the
summer so uses the following rates:
{
l,
\lambda,
i \neq July, August
\lambda
l i =
		
ul,
i = July, August
u\lambda,
(i)
Write down the probability function of X i . .

The analyst wishes to estimate u and \lambda using data from the last 12 months.
(ii)
Show that the log likelihood is given by
l l ( ( x x ; ; \lambda , , u u ) ) = ∑ x x i i ln
ln \lambda − (10
(10 + 2 2 u u ) ) \lambda + ( ( x x Jul
x Aug
ln u u + C
C
Jul + x
Aug ) ) ln
i i
where C is a constant, independent of u and \lambda.

Derive the maximum likelihood estimators for u and \lambda. You are not required to
function.
confirm that these estimators maximise the likelihood function.

There were mixed answers in parts (i) and (ii), often with poor notation
for the likelihood. Part (iii) was well answered.
