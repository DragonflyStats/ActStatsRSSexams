Part (i) was answered correctly by the majority of candidates. Part (ii)
was well answered, although many candidates used incorrect limits of
integration. Part (iii) was generally answered well. Parts (iv)-(vi) were
not answered particularly well, while a number of candidates did not
attempt them at all.

In part (iv) many candidates did not use the correct expression, and in
part (v) candidates struggled with the calculation and the correct limits
of integration. In part (vi) some candidates provided a general proof of
the equation, which is not what was required here.

common \hat{p} = ( 36 + 25 ) / ( 124 + 136 ) = 0.23 5

\begin{itemize}
\item As the sample is large we can use a normal approximation.
\[Test statistic =
( \hat{p}_1 − \hat{p}_2 )
\hat{p} (1 − \hat{p} ) /124 + \hat{p} (1 − \hat{p} ) /136\]
= ( 0.290 − 0.184 )
0.235 ( 1 − 0.235 ) /124 + 0.235 ( 1 − 0.235 ) /136
= 0.106
0 .00145 + 0.00132
= 2.014

\item As Z 0.975 = 1.96 is less than the test statistic we reject H 0 : p 1 = p 2 at a 5%
significance level.

\item (ii)
H 0 : Proportions are the same.

The answers in part (i) were generally good. Common errors included not calculating a common proportion p and calculation mistakes when
computing the test statistic. Part (ii) was also well answered in general, although there were some calculation errors. Part (iii) (a) was well
answered by most candidates. Answers in (iii)(b) were mixed, with most candidates making the correct observation. However, many candidates
failed to identify appropriate reasoning.

(Alternative solution: using the t 99 distribution and interpolation to obtain the
critical value 1.987, gives confidence interval of (13.84, 14.36).)

which is approximately standard normal under H 0 due to the large sample
size (100 drivers per age).

The p -value is therefore very close to 0,

and the null hypothesis is rejected. We conclude that the average annual
mileage at age 50 is not the same as the average annual mileage at age 40.

For the correlation coefficient in part (iii) the variation amongst drivers of the
same age is ignored.

(Therefore there seems to be a stronger linear relationship between age and
annual mileage than for the case where variations amongst drivers of the same
age is considered (part (iv)).
(v) Only if the variance in each group is zero will the two coefficients coincide.

(vi) We have
S xy =∑ x i y i − ( ∑ x i ) ( ∑ y i ) / n = 100 × 5,942 −

%Part (i) was very well answered. Answers in part (ii) were mostly correct. Some candidates used a t99 distribution with pooled variance, in which case an assumption of equal variances needs to be made and explicitly mentioned. Part (iii) was well answered in general. Answers in parts (iv)-(v) were mixed, with many students failing to state in (iv) that the variation was ignored. Part (vi) was not particularly well answered, with many candidates using the Sxy and Sxx sums from a previous part without further explanation regarding why they would be the same here.
