A poll was conducted with respect to a future referendum, where voters will answer either “yes” or “no” to a question on a political issue. A random sample of 1,106 eligible voters were asked in the poll and 608 of them answered “no”. Let p denote
the true population proportion of “no” voters.
We wish to predict the result of the referendum, by testing the hypotheses H 0 : p = 0.5 against H 1 : p > 0.5.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item (i) Perform a suitable test of these hypotheses at the 5% level of significance,
stating your conclusion in terms of a predicted result for the referendum.  
\item (ii) (a) Determine a 90% central confidence interval for p.
(b) Explain the effect of using a larger sample on the confidence interval in
part (ii)(a). 

(a) Give the definition of the P-value of a hypothesis test.
(b) Derive the P-value of the test in part (i) stating your conclusion in
terms of a predicted result for the referendum.
(c) Comment, with reference to your answers in parts (i) and (iii)(b), on
the advantages of using a P-value approach for testing, compared with
level.

An analyst wishes to model the number of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) on the local stock exchange each calendar month. Let X i be a random variable denoting the number of IPOs in month i, where all X i ’s are independent. The analyst wishes to
model X i using a Poisson distribution but is aware that there is less activity during the
summer so uses the following rates:
{

\lambda,
i ≠ July, August

\item (i)
Write down the probability function of X i . .

The analyst wishes to estimate u and \lambda using data from the last 12 months.

Q6
(i)
If X denotes the “no” voters, under H 0 we have
X ~ Binomial(1106, 0.5), or approximately X ~ N(553, 276.5)

Using a continuity correction, the z statistic is given as
zz =
607.5−553
√276.5
= 3.28
[1.5]
Critical point for tables is z 0.05 = 1.6449.
[0.5]
So we reject H 0 at the 5% level in favour of H 1 ,
which means that we have evidence of a “no” vote.
(ii)
pp� (1−pp� )
(a) 90% CI is given by pp̂ ± 1.6449 �
This gives:
608
(
± 1.6449 �
1106
nn

608
)(1−608/1106)
1106
1106

, i.e. (0.525, 0.574)

(b) A larger sample would reduce the standard error of pp̂ and would therefore give a
narrower interval.

(iii)
(a) The P-value is the probability, assuming H 0 is true, of observing a test statistic at
least as “extreme” as the value observed (or, it is the lowest significance level at
which H 0 can be rejected).

(b) PP-value = PP(XX ≥ 608) = PP �ZZ >
607.5−553
√276.5
� = PP(ZZ > 3.28) = 0.00052

We have very strong evidence against H 0 , which means that we have very strong
evidence of a “no” vote.

(c) Using a fixed level does not provide clear detailed information on the strength of
the evidence against H 0 , whereas using a P-value is more informative about the
Page 6Subject CT3  – September 2018 – Examiners’ Report
strength of this evidence.
Here, using the P-value approach clearly tells us about how strong the evidence
against H 0 is, which means we can put our conclusion in stronger terms.

Generally well answered. Notice that a continuity correction is needed
in this question for full marks. In part (i) many candidates mistakenly
used the sample estimate of p in the variance.

There were mixed answers in parts (i) and (ii), often with poor notation
for the likelihood. Part (iii) was well answered.
