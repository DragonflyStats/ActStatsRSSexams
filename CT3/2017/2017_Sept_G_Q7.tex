The annual number of claims an insurance company incurs, N, is believed to follow
a Poisson distribution with mean $l$. The value of each claim X i , i = 1, 2, ... follows
a known distribution with mean m and variance s 2 . The value of each claim is
independent of the value of any other claim and of the number of claims. Let
S = X 1 + X 2 + ... + X N denote the total claims in any given year.

%%The answer in part (i) was given in a variety of forms, and credit was given as appropriate. There were various errors or incomplete answers in part (ii), with many candidates showing knowledge of the required
%% steps but failing to derive the correct answer mainly due to algebra and differentiation problems.
