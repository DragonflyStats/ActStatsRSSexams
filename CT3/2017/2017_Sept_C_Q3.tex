\noindent Let $\{X_1 , X_2 , ..., X_n\}$ be a random sample of independent random variables from a
$N(\mu, \sigma^2 )$ distribution.


\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item % (i) 
Comment on the shape of the sampling distribution of the sample variance $S^2$
with respect to the sample size n.
\item %(ii)
 Determine the variance of $S^2$ based on its sampling distribution.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item For small n the distribution is heavily skewed to the right.
\item As n gets larger the distribution becomes symmetric.

%In part (i) the quality of the answers was mixed. Many candidates
%failed to comment with respect to the sample size n. Part (ii) was better answered.
