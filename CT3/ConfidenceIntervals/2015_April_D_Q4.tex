	%% - Question 4 
	\noindent An insurance company experiences claims from 290 insurance policies in a year on a portfolio of 900 policies. Only one claim can be made on a policy in a year. The company assumes that all policies are independent of each other.
	
	
	\noindent Determine a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of policies on which a claim is made in a year. 
	
	\medskip
	\noindent \textbf{Solution}
	
	
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	%-  4 No. claims ~Bin(900,p)
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Point Estimate: Sample Proportion
		\[\hat{p} = \frac{290}{900} \;=\; 0.322  \]
		\item Sample size $n=900$. Large sample so we can assume normality by the Central Limit Theorem.
		\[ \hat{p} \sim N \left( p, \frac{p(1-p)}{n} \right) \]
		\item The quantile for a 95\% confidence interval is $Z_{0.975} \;=\; 1.96$.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		95\% \mbox{ Confidence Interval } &=& \hat{p} \pm Z_{0.975} \times \sqrt{  \frac{\hat{p} \times ( 1 \;-\;  \hat{p}) }{n}  } \\
		& & \\
		&=&  0.322 \pm 1.96 \times  \sqrt{  \frac{0.322 \times ( 1 \;-\;  0.322) }{900}  } \\
		& & \\
		&=&  0.322 \pm 1.96 \times  \sqrt{  \frac{0.2183 }{900}  } \\
		& & \\
		&=& 0.322 \pm (1.96 \times \sqrt{0.0002426} )\\
		& & \\
		&=& 0.322 \pm (1.96 \times 0.01557)\\
		& & \\
		&=& 0.322 \pm 0.0305\\
		& & \\
		&=& ( 0.2915,  0.3525 )\\
