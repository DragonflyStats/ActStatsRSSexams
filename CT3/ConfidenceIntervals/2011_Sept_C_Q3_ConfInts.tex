%% Question 3
\large
\noindent A random sample of 60 adult men who live in Leeds includes 21 who have visited Majorca. An independent random sample of 70 adult women who live in Leeds includes 28 who have visited Majorca.
Calculate a 98\% confidence interval for the proportion of adults who live in Leeds
who have visited Majorca.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\medskip 
\noindent \textbf{Solution}
\begin{itemize}
\item The point estimate is the sample proportion ${ \displaystyle \hat{\pi}  \;=\; 49/130  }$
\item Interval Size : 98\%
\item Sample Size : $n=130$
\item We consider this a large sample (i.e. $n \geq 30$), and assume the sampling distribution is approximated by the Normal distribution.
\end{itemize}

90\%     & $Z_{0.95}$ & 1.645 \\ \hline
95\%     & $Z_{0.975}$ & 1.96 \\ \hline
98\%    & $Z_{0.99}$ & 2.326    \\ \hline
99\%    & $Z_{0.995}$ &  2.576  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\begin{framed}
\[ S.E.( \pi) \;=\; \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{\pi} (1\;-\;\hat{\pi})  }{n}  } \]
\end{framed}

\noindent \textbf{Calculation of Confidence Interval}\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{98\% Confidence Interval} &=& 0.3769 \pm 2.326 \times  \sqrt{    \frac{ (0.3769 \times 0.6231)  }{130 }   }\\
&=& 0.3769 \pm 0.0989 \\
&=& (0.278, 0.476) \\
\end{eqnarray*}
