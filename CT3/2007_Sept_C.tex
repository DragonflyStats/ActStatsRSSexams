For a particular insurance company a sample of eight claim amounts (in units of
8
£1,000) on household contents is taken. The data give
∑ X_{i} = 56.7 and
i = 1
8
∑ X_{i} 2 = 403.95 .
The claim amounts are assumed to follow a normal distribution.
i = 1
6
(i) Calculate a 90% confidence interval for the true mean claim amount.
[3]
(ii) Use the confidence interval calculated in (i) above to comment on an expert’s
assessment that the average claim amount for the company is £6,500.

In an investigation into the relationship between two normally distributed variables, X
and Y, based on a sample of 15 points, it is desired to perform the following test
concerning the true underlying correlation coefficient ρ
H 0 : ρ = 0 v H 1 : ρ > 0.
Use the t distribution to determine an upper critical value for the sample correlation
coefficient r for this test at the 1% level.

i.e. the 90% CI is (6.722, 7.453), or (£6722, £7453).

The value £6500 is not included in the CI above, and therefore we conclude
that the data are not consistent with the expert’s assessment at the 10%
significance level.
Use the result
r n − 2
1 − r 2
~ t n − 2 under H 0 .
From tables t 0.01,13 = 2.650
so critical value is solution of
r

13 = 2.65

= 0.592
Solving gives r =

From the Yellow Book:
Mean:
E(S) = E(N)E(X) = (20)(10000) = £200,000
Variance: var(S) = E(N) var(X) + var(N)[E(X)] 2
= 20(2000 2 ) + 20(10000 2 ) = 2080 × 10 6
∴ Standard deviation = £45607
[ OR , using compound Poisson results (in Yellow Book)
E(S) = λm 1 and var(S) = λm 2 where λ = E(N) and m r = E(X r )]
