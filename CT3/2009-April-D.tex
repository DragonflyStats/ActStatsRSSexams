An analysis of variance investigation with samples of size eight for each of four
treatments results in the following ANOVA table.

(i) Calculate the observed F statistic, specify an interval in which the resulting
P-value lies, and state your conclusion clearly.

(ii) The four treatment means are:
y 1 = 85.0, y 2 = 66.5, y 3 = 59.0, and y 4 = 95.5 .
(a) Calculate the least significant difference between pairs of means using
a 5% level.
(b) List the means in order, illustrate the non-significant pairs using
suitable underlining, and comment briefly.

from tables F 3,28 (1%) = 4.568
∴ P-value < 0.01 or 0 < P-v < 0.01
So there is overwhelming evidence of a difference between the underlying
treatment means.

Treatments 2 & 3 are separate from treatments 1 & 4 which have
significantly higher means.

E [ N ] = 0.7(0) + 0.15(1) + 0.1(2) + 0.05(3) = 0.5
E ⎡ N 2 ⎤ = 0.15(1) + 0.1(4) + 0.05(9) = 1.00 ∴ Var [ N ] = 1.00 − 0.5 2 = 0.75

Let S = total of the claim amounts.
E [ S ] = E [ N ] E [ X ] = (0.5)(20) = 10 , i.e. £10,000.
V [ S ] = E [ N ] Var [ X ] + Var [ N ] [ E ( X )] 2 = (0.5)(200) + (0.75)(20) 2 = 400
∴ sd ( S ) = 20 , i.e. £20,000.
