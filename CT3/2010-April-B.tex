It is assumed that the numbers of claims arising in one year from motor insurance
policies for young male drivers and young female drivers are distributed as Poisson
random variables with parameters λ m and λ f respectively.
Independent random samples of 120 policies for young male drivers and 80 policies
for young female drivers were examined and yielded the following mean number of
claims per policy in the last calendar year: x m = 0.24 and x f = 0.15 .
Calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval for λ m − λ f , the difference between
the respective Poisson parameters.

A computer routine selects one of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 at random and replicates
the process a total of 100 times. Let S denote the sum of the 100 numbers selected.
Calculate the approximate probability that S assumes a value between 280 and 320
inclusive.

Specify the distribution of
∑ X i .
i = 1
(b)
Justify the fact that 2n λ X has a χ 2 k distribution, where X is the mean
of the sample, by using a suitable relationship between the gamma and
the χ 2 distribution, and specify the degrees of freedom k.
