In a portfolio of car insurance policies, the number of accident-related claims, N,
made by a policyholder in a year has the following distribution:
No. of claims, n
Probability
0
1
2
0.4 0.4 0.2
The number of cars, X, involved in each accident that results in a claim is distributed
as follows:
No. of cars, x
Probability
1
2
0.7 0.3
It can be assumed that the occurrence of a claim and the number of cars involved in
the accident are independent. Furthermore, claims made by a policyholder in any year
are also independent of each other. Let S be the total number of cars involved in
accidents related to such claims by a policyholder in a year.
(i)
(a)
(b)
Determine the probability function of S.
Hence find E(S).
[4]
The expectation E(S) can also be calculated using the formula
2
E ( S ) = âˆ‘ E ( S | N = n ) Pr ( N = n ) .
n = 0
(ii)
(a)
(b)
Find E ( S | N = n ) for n = 0,1 , 2 .
Hence calculate E(S).
