\begin{enumerate}
\item 
4 Calculate a 99\% confidence interval for the percentage of claims for household accidental damage which are fully settled within six months of being submitted, given
that in a random sample of 100 submitted claims of this type, exactly 83 were fully settled within six months of being submitted.

\end{enumerate}

Sample proportion = 0.83
99\% CI for the population proportion is 0.83
i.e. 0.83 0.0968 i.e. (0.733, 0.927)
99\% CI for percentage is thus (73.3% , 92.7%)
