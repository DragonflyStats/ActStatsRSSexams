%% Question 11
Consider the following simple model for the number of claims, N, which occur in a  year on a policy:
0
0.55
n
P(N = n)
1
0.25
2
0.15
3
0.05
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item (a) Explain how you would simulate an observation of $N$ using a number $r$, an observation of a random variable which is uniformly distributed on $(0, 1)$.
\item (b) Illustrate your method described in (i) by simulating three observations of $N$ using the following random numbers between 0 and 1: 0.6221, 0.1472, 0.9862.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
11
(a)
For 0 r < 0.55
0.55 r < 0.8
0.8 r < 0.95
0.95 r 1
n = 0
n = 1
n = 2
n = 3
[OR any equivalent allocation which reflects the probabilities of the 4 values
of N.]
