%%-Question 3
Claim sizes in a certain insurance situation are modelled by a distribution with
moment generating function M(t) given by
\[M(t) = (1 10t) 2 .\]
Show that $E[X^2 ] = 600$ and find the value of $E[X^3 ]$.

\begin{itemize}
\item ${ \displaystyle  M (t) = (1 10t) 2 }$
\item ${ \displaystyle M (t) = ( 2)( 10)(1 10t) 3 = 20(1 10t) 3 }$
\item ${ \displaystyle  M (t) = ( 60)( 10)(1 10t) 4 = 600(1 10t) 4}$
\item ${ \displaystyle  M (t) = ( 2400)( 10)(1 10t) 5 = 24000(1 10t)}$
\end{itemize}

Putting t = 0
Putting t = 0
E[X 2 ] = 600
E[X 3 ] = 24000
[OR use the power series expansion M(t) = 1 + 20t + 600t 2 /2! + 24000t 3 /3! +
[OR use the result on E[X r ] for a gamma(2,0.1) variable in the Yellow Book]
