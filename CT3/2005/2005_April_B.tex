Consider a random sample of size 16 taken from a normal distribution with mean = 25 and variance 2 = 4. 
Let the sample mean be denoted X .
State the distribution of X and hence calculate the probability that X assumes a value greater than 26.

5
Consider a random sample of size 21 taken from a normal distribution with mean
= 25 and variance 2 = 4. Let the sample variance be denoted S 2 .
State the distribution of the statistic 5S 2 and hence find the variance of the statistic S 2 .

6
In a survey conducted by a mail order company a random sample of 200 customers yielded 172 who indicated that they were highly satisfied with the delivery time of their orders.
Calculate an approximate 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of the
company s customers who are highly satisfied with delivery times.
