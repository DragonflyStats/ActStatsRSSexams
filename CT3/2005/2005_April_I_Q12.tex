%%--- Question 12
(i)
 A random variable $Y$ has a Poisson distribution with parameter but there is a restriction that zero counts cannot occur. The distribution of $Y$ in this case is referred to as the zero-truncated Poisson distribution.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
Show that the probability function of Y is given by
y
p ( y ) =
(ii)
e
y !(1 e )
( y = 1, 2, ).
(b) Show that E [ Y ] = /(1 e ).

(a) Let y 1 , , y n denote a random sample from the zero-truncated Poisson distribution.
Show that the maximum likelihood estimate of by the solution to the following equation:
y
e
may be determined
= 0,
1 e
and deduce that the maximum likelihood estimate is the same as the method of moments estimate.
(b)
\item (iii)
Obtain an expression for the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRlb) for the variance of an unbiased estimator of .

The following table gives the numbers of occupants in 2,423 cars observed on a road junction during a certain time period on a weekday morning.

The above data were modelled by a zero-truncated Poisson distribution as given in (i).
The maximum likelihood estimate of is = 0.8925 and the Cramer-Rao lower bound on variance at = 0.8925 is 5.711574 10 4 (you do not need to verify these results.)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item (a) Obtain the expected frequencies for the fitted model, and use a $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit test to show that the model is appropriate for the data.
\item (b) Calculate an approximate 95\% confidence interval for and hence calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the mean of the zero-truncated Poisson distribution.
