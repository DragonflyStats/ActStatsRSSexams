3 Claim amounts on a certain type of policy are modelled as following a gamma
distribution with parameters = 120 and = 1.2.
Calculate an approximate value for the probability that an individual claim amount
exceeds 120, giving a reason for the approach you use.

A random variable X that is gamma-distributed with shape α and rate \beta is denoted 
\[ {\displaystyle X\sim \Gamma (\alpha ,\beta )\equiv \operatorname {Gamma} (\alpha ,\beta )}  {\displaystyle X\sim \Gamma (\alpha ,\beta )\equiv \operatorname {Gamma} (\alpha ,\beta )}\]




a shape parameter $\alpha$
a rate parameter $\beta$



For large k the gamma distribution converges to normal distribution with mean μ = kθ and variance σ2 = kθ2.
