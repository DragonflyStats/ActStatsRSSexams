%%- Question 6
A random sample of 16 observations was selected from each of four populations. Given that the between treatments mean square is 280 and the total sum of squares is $SS_T = 1,500$, construct an analysis of variance table and test the null hypothesis that the means of the four populations are equal.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5
\begin{itemize}
    \item 4 groups / populations
    \item Between Group degrees of freedom $p-1 = 3$
    \item 16 sampled from each group
    \item Overall sample size $n = 4 \times 16 = 64$
    \item Total degrees of freedom = $n-1 = 63$
    
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
Source of variation	&	d.f.	&	SS	&	MSS	&	F	\\ \hline
Between groups	&	3	&	….	&	280	&	?	\\ \hline
Residual	&	….	&	….	&	….	&		\\ \hline
Total	&	63	&	1500	&		&		\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
Source of variation	&	d.f.	&	SS	&	MSS	&	F	\\ \hline
Between groups	&	3	&	840	&	280	&	25.45	\\ \hline
Residual	&	60	&	660	&	11	&		\\ \hline
Total	&	63	&	1500	&		&		\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
F = 280/11 which equals 25.45.

\end{verbatim}
Therefore there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that the four population
means are not equal $(F 3,60 (5\%) = 2.758, F 3,60 (1\%) = 4.126)$.
