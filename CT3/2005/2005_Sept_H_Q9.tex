%% Question 9
Random samples are taken from two independent normally distributed populations
(with means 1 and 2 respectively) with the following results.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sample from population 1:
sample size n 1 = 11, sample mean x 1 124 , sample variance s 1 2
59
Sample from population 2:
sample size n 2 = 15, sample mean x 2 105 , sample variance s 2 2
42
\end{itemize}

Calculate a 95\%  confidence interval for 1
2 , the difference between the
population means (you may assume that the population variances are equal).
