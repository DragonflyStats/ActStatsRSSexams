Let $X$ denote a random variable with a continuous uniform $(0, 1000)$ distribution. Define a random variable $Y$ as the minimum of X and 800.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item (i) Show that the conditional distribution of X given $X < 800$ is a continuous uniform (0, 800) distribution.
\item (ii) Verify (giving clear reasons) that the expectation of the random variable Y is 480.
\item (iii) Suppose that Y 1 , , Y n are independent and identically distributed, each with the same distribution as Y.
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the case that n is large, determine the approximate distribution of
1 n
Y =
Y i , stating its expectation. (You are not required to derive or state
n i 1
the variance of Y .)
[1]
(iv)

Comment on the comparison of the conditional expectation of X given X < 800 with the expectation of Y.

%% Question 11
Consider the following simple model for the number of claims, N, which occur in a  year on a policy:
0
0.55
n
P(N = n)
1
0.25
2
0.15
3
0.05
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item (a) Explain how you would simulate an observation of $N$ using a number $r$, an observation of a random variable which is uniformly distributed on $(0, 1)$.
\item (b) Illustrate your method described in (i) by simulating three observations of $N$ using the following random numbers between 0 and 1: 0.6221, 0.1472, 0.9862.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$X ~ U(0,1000)$ , $Y = min(X,800)$
(i)

P ( X
x | X
800)
P ( X
x and X 800)
P ( X 800)
P ( X x )
for 0 < x < 800
800 /1000
x /1000
800 /1000
x
for 0
800
x 800
so the conditional distribution is $U(0,800)$

[other reasonable arguments were given credit, e.g. the conditional distribution is simply a scaled version of the original uniform distribution on a restricted range .]

(ii)

E[Y] = E[X|X < 800] P(X < 800) + 800 P(X
400
= 480

800)

(iii) $Y$ is approximately normal with expectation 480 by Central Limit Theorem
(iv) $E[X | X < 800] = 400$ whereas $E[Y] = 480$.
The higher value for E[Y] results from 20\% of the Y values being 800 (and 80\% being between 0 and 800).
