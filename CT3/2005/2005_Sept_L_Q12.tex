A certain type of insurance policy has a claim rate of per year and the cover ceases and the policy expires after the first claim. Accordingly the duration of a policy is modelled by an exponential distribution with density function e x : 0 x
.
A company has data on (m + n) policies which have expired and which may beassumed to be independent. Of these, m policies had duration less than 5 years and n policies had duration greater than or equal to 5 years.

\begin{enumerate}
\item (i)
An investigator makes note of the actual durations, x 1 , , x n , of the latter group of n policies, but ignores the former group without even noting the value of m.

The two investigators decide to pool their data, and so have the information that there are $m$ policies with duration less than 5 years, and n policies with actual durations $x 1 , ... , x n$ .
