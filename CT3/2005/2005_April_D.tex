%%- Question 10
\item A model used for claim amounts ($X$, in units of \$10,000) in certain circumstances has
the following probability density function, $f(x)$, and cumulative distribution function,
\[ F(x):
f ( x ) =
5(10 5 )
(10 x )
, x
6
0 ; F ( x ) = 1
10
10 x
5\]
.
You are given the information that the distribution of X has mean 2.5 units (\$25,000)
and standard deviation 3.23 units (\$32,300).
\begin{enumerate}
\item (i) Describe briefly the nature of a model for claim sizes for which the standard deviation can be greater than the mean.
\item 
(ii) (a)
Show that we can obtain a simulated observation of X by calculating
x = 10 (1 r )
0.2
1
where r is an observation of a random variable which is uniformly
distributed on (0,1).
(b)
Explain why we can just as well use the formula
x = 10 r
0.2
1
to obtain a simulated observation of X.
(c)
Calculate the missing values for the simulated claim amounts in the table below (which has been obtained using the method in (ii)(b)
above):

% --- Question 11
Twenty insects were used in an experiment to examine the effect on their activity level, $y$, of 3 standard preparations of a chemical. The insects were randomly assigned, 4 to receive each of the preparations and 8 to remain untreated as controls.
Their activity levels were metered from vibrations in a test chamber and were as
follows:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item (i) Conduct an analysis of variance test to establish whether the data indicate
significant differences amongst the results for the four treatments.

(b) Make a rough plot of the residuals against the treatment means.
(c) State the assumptions underlying the analysis of variance test
conducted in part (i).
(d) Comment on how well the data conform to these assumptions in the
light of the residual plot.
[8]
\item It is suggested that any differences can be explained in terms of a difference
between controls on the one hand and treated groups on the other.
Comment on any evidence for this and state how you would formally test for
this effect (but do not carry out the test).

\begin{itemize}
\item (i) X takes positive values only so to have such a relatively high standard deviation the distribution must be positively skewed with sizeable probability
associated with high values (i.e. the model embraces high claim sizes; the density has a long or heavy tail).
\item (ii) (a) Solving r = F(x)
\item (b) R ~ U(0,1) 1 R ~ U(0, 1) so (1 r) is also a random number from (0, 1), so we can use 1 r in place of r , giving the formula
x 10 r

P-value is lower than 0.05 (but higher than 0.01), so we can reject H 0 at least
at the 5% level of testing (Note: actually P-value is 0.032). The data do
indicate significant differences amongst the treatment means.

Examiners Report
\begin{itemize}
\item (c) Observations Y ij (j th value for treatment i) are independent and
normally distributed with variance 2 which is constant across
treatments.
\item (d) The assumptions seem reasonable
with the exception of the constant
variance assumption, which is questionable
the data for preparation
\item A appear to be less variable than the data for the other treatments.
The control mean is lower than all three treatment means
(48.4 v 63.5, 67.5, 73.0) so there is prima facie evidence to support the suggestion.
\item One could perform a two-sample t-test of control mean = treatment mean by combining the data for the 3 preparations (and using samples of sizes 8 and 12).
