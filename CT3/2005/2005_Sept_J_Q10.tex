Let $X$ denote a random variable with a continuous uniform $(0, 1000)$ distribution. Define a random variable $Y$ as the minimum of X and 800.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that the conditional distribution of X given $X < 800$ is a continuous uniform (0, 800) distribution.
\item Verify (giving clear reasons) that the expectation of the random variable $Y$ is 480.
\item Suppose that Y 1 , , Y n are independent and identically distributed, each with the same distribution as $Y$.
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the case that n is large, determine the approximate distribution of
1 n
Y =
Y i , stating its expectation. (You are not required to derive or state
n i 1
the variance of Y .)

(iv)

Comment on the comparison of the conditional expectation of X given X < 800 with the expectation of Y.

%% Question 11

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$X ~ U(0,1000)$ , $Y = min(X,800)$

\begin{itemize}
\item (i)

P ( X
x | X
800)
P ( X
x and X 800)
P ( X 800)
P ( X x )
for 0 < x < 800
800 /1000
x /1000
800 /1000
x
for 0
800
x 800
so the conditional distribution is $U(0,800)$

[other reasonable arguments were given credit, e.g. the conditional distribution is simply a scaled version of the original uniform distribution on a restricted range .]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 
(ii)

E[Y] = E[X|X < 800] P(X < 800) + 800 P(X
400
= 480

\item 
(iii) $Y$ is approximately normal with expectation 480 by Central Limit Theorem

\item (iv) $E[X | X < 800] = 400$ whereas $E[Y] = 480$.
The higher value for $E[Y]$ results from 20\% of the Y values being 800 (and 80\% being between 0 and 800).
