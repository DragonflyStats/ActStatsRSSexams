%%- Quesiton 4
\noindent An airline is analysing the punctuality of its scheduled flights. It measures departures and arrivals and classifies them as early, on time and late.


\noindent From its records no flights depart early and 85\% depart on time. Arrivals are early 10\% of the time and late 20\% of the time.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $D_{O}$ = departs on time, $D_L$ = departs late.
\item Let $A_E$ = arrives early, $A_{O}$ = arrives on time and $A_L$ = arrives late.
\end{itemize}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(D_E) = 0.00$
\item $P(D_O) = 0.85$
\item $P(A_E) = 0.10$
\item $P(A_L) = 0.20$
\end{itemize}

\begin{eqnarray*}
P (A_{O}) &=& 1- [ P (A_{E}) + P (A_{L}) ] \\

Further analysis shows that:
\begin{itemize}
\item none of the flights that depart late will arrive early.
\item 10\% of the flights that depart on time are late arrivals.
\end{itemize}

\begin{framed}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(A_E | D_L) = 0.00$
\item $P(A_L | D_O) = 0.10$

time.\smallskip

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

We are asked to find $P ( A_{E} | D_{O} )$


\begin{itemize}
    \item No early departures.  $P( D_E) = 0$ and consequently $P( A_E | D_E) = 0$.
    \item We are told $P( A_E | D_L) = 0$.
    \item So $P ( A_E \cap D_{O} )  \;=\; P ( A_E ) \;=\; 0.1 $
\end{itemize}



\begin{eqnarray*} P ( A_{E} | D_{O} ) &=& 
\frac{P ( A_{E} \cap D_{O} )}{P (  D_{O}
)} \\
&=& \frac{0.1}{0.85}\\  & & \\&=& 0.1176\\
\end{eqnarray*}

%\noindent \textbf{Alternative Approach}\\

%\begin{eqnarray*} P ( D_{O} | A_{E} ) &=&
%\frac{P ( A_{E} \cap D_{O} )}{P ( A_E )} \\
%&=& \frac{0.1}{0.1}\\  &=& 1\\
%\end{eqnarray*}

%\begin{eqnarray*} P ( A_{E} | D_{O} ) &=& 
%\frac{P ( D_{O} | A_{E} ) \times P ( A_{E})}{P ( D_{O} )} \\
%&=& \frac{1 \times 0.1}{0.85}\\  &=& 0.1176\\

%Part (i) was answered correctly by the vast majority of candidates. The
%rest of the question was not well answered. Most candidates showed
%understanding of the probabilities in the context required here, but
%many struggled in applying the conditional forms correctly throughout.
