Let X be a discrete random variable with the following probability distribution:
X:
P(X = x):
(i)
0
0.4
1
0.3
2
0.2
3
0.1
Simulate three observations of X using the following three random numbers
from a uniform distribution on (0,1) (you should explain your method briefly
and clearly).
Random numbers: 0.4936, 0.7269, 0.1652

Let X be a random variable with cumulative distribution function:
F X ( x ) =
(ii)

1
1 − e − 1
( 1 − e ) ,
− x 2
0 < x < 1 (F X (x) = 0 for $x \leq 0$ and $F X (x) = 1$ for $x \geq 1$).

Derive an expression for a simulated value of X using a random number $u$ from a uniform distribution on (0,1) and hence simulate an observation of $X$ using the random number u = 0.8149.
