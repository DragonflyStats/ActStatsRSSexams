%%-- April 2010 -- Question 4 --%
Let $\{X_1, X_2, \ldots X_n\}$ be a random sample of size $n$ from a population with mean $\mu$ and
variance $\sigma^2$.
Let the sample mean be $\bar{X}$ and the sample variance be 
\[S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \left( \sum X^2_i - n \bar{X}^2 right).\]

You may assume that $E[\bar{X}] = \mu$ and
$\operatorname{Var}[\bar{X}] = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$.
Show that $E[S^2]= \sigma^2$ .

%===============%

\begin{eqnarray*}
E[S^2]
&=& \frac{1}{n-1} \left[ \sum E(X_i^2) - n E(bar{X}^2) \right]\\
&=& \frac{1}{n-1} \left[ \sum (\sigma^2 + \mu^2) - n E(\frac{\sigma^2}{n} + \mu^2) \right]\\
&=& \frac{1}{n-1} \left[ n (\sigma^2 + \mu^2) - \sigma^2 - n \mu^2 \right]\\
&=& \frac{1}{n-1} \left[ (n-1) \sigma^2 \right]\\
&=& \sigma^2
\end{eqnarray*}
