\begin{document}
As part of a project in a modelling module, a statistics student is required to submit a
report on the sums insured on home contents insurance policies based on samples of such policies covering risks in five medium-sized towns in each of England, Wales,and Scotland. Data are provided on the average sum insured (Y, in units of £1,000)
for each of the 15 towns and are as follows:
England
y 11.9 11.1 9.5 9.2
For these data:

= 55.6 (England), 36.8 (Wales), 44.7 (Scotland)
overall
\sum y = 137.1, \sum y 2
= 1,316.63
The student decides to use an analysis of variance approach.

Suggest brief comments the student should make on the basis of the plot

The lecturer of the module decides to provide further information. It has been suggested that the value of a UK index of the town’s prosperity (X) might also be a useful explanatory variable (in addition to the country in which the town is situated).
The data on the index are as follows (for the towns in the same order as in the first
table):

The student decides to add the results of a regression approach to her report, using “index” as an explanatory variable, so she fits the regression model
$Y = a + bX + e$
using the least squares criterion.


Part of the output from fitting the model using a statistics package on a computer is as follows:
Coefficients: Estimate
(Intercept) 3.46166
x
0.25889
Residual standard error:
R-Squared: 0.3449

0.09896
2.616 0.0213*
1.789 on 13 degrees of freedom

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Verify (by performing your own calculations) the following results for the fitted model as given in the output above:
\begin{itemize}
\item (a) the fitted regression line is y = 3.462 + 0.2589x
\item (b) the percentage of the variation in the response (y) explained by the model (x) is 34.5%
\item (c) the standard error of the slope estimate is 0.09896
\end{itemize}
\item (iv) Comment briefly on the usefulness of “index” as a predictor for the average sum insured.
\item 
(v) Suggest another model which you think might be more successful in explaining the variability in the values of the average sum insured and provide a better predictor.

(i)
(ii)
\begin{itemize}
\item the three sets of points are positioned at different levels (the means are shown), so there is a prima facie case for suggesting that the underlying means are different (i.e. there are country effects)
\item the means are in the order England (highest), Scotland, Wales (lowest)
\item the variation in the data for Scotland is perhaps lower than that for
England, but with only 5 observations for each country, we cannot be sure
that there is a real underlying difference in variance
\end{itemize}

SS T = 1316.63 – 137.1 2 /15 = 63.536, SS B = (55.6 2 + 36.8 2 + 44.7 2 ) /
5 – 137.1 2 /15 = 35.644
∴ SS R = 63.536 – 35.644 = 27.892

Under H 0 : no country effects F = 17.82/2.324 = 7.67 on (2,12) df
P-value of F = 7.67 is less than 0.01, so we reject H 0 and conclude that there are differences among the population means of the average sum
insured

We have strong evidence that country effects exist − the means appear
to be in the order England (highest), Scotland, Wales (lowest).

(a)
S xx = 7543 – 329 2 /15 = 326.9333, S yy = 63.536 (from (i)(b) above)
S xy = 3091.7 – 329×137.1/15 = 84.64
ˆ ( 329 /15 ) = 3.4617
\[β ˆ = 84.64 / 326.9333 = 0.25889 ,\] 
\[α ˆ = 137.1/15 − β×\]
So fitted line is y = 3.462 + 0.2589 x
(b) R 2 = S xy 2 /( S xx S yy ) = 84.64 2 /(326.9333×63.536) = 0.34488 so 34.5%
(c) SSRES = S yy – S xy 2 / S xx = 63.536 – 84.64 2 /326.9333 = 41.62349
⇒ σ ˆ 2 = 41.62349 /13 = 3.201807
()
1/2
⇒ s . e . β ˆ = ( 3.201807 / 326.9333 ) = 0.09896
(iv)
\begin{itemize}
\item From the plot we see that the relationship between “index” and “average sum insured” is weak, positive (and possibly linear) – the percentage of the variation in “average sum insured” explained by the relationship with “index”
is only 34.5\%.
\item So “index” is of some, but limited, use as a predictor of “average sum
insured”.
\end{itemize}
(v)
\begin{itemize}
\item We should try a “multiple regression” model which includes “country” and
“index” in the model.
\item[ Note: although not explicitly in the syllabus, a comment to the effect that
“Country” should be included as a qualitative variable (a “factor”) e.g. by
using a text vector (with entries “ E ”, “ W ”, “ S ” say) or a pair of (Bernoulli)
dummy variables, may attract a bonus for a borderline candidate.]
