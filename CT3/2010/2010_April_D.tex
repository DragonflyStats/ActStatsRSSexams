%%--- Question 9
\item The number of claims, N, arising over a period of five years for a particular policy is assumed to follow a “Type 2” negative binomial distribution (as in the book of
k (1 − p )
Formulae and Tables page 9) with mean E [ N ] =
and variance
\[p^k (1 − p )\]
.
\[V [ N ] =p^2\]
Each claim amount, X (in units of £1,000), is assumed to follow an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda$ independently of each other claim amount and of the number of claims.

Let S be the total of the claim amounts for the period of five years, in the case
k = 2, p = 0.8 and $\lambda=2$.
\item 
Calculate the mean and the standard deviation of $S$ based on the above assumptions.

Now assume that:
\begin{itemize}
\item  N follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\mu = 0.5$, that is, with the same mean as N above;
\item  X follows a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha = 2$ and $\lambda = 4$, that is, with the same mean as $X$ above.
\end{itemize}

10
Calculate the mean and the standard deviation of S based on these
assumptions.
Compare the two sets of answers  above.

\item The size of claims (in units of £1,000) arising from a portfolio of house contents
insurance policies can be modelled using a random variable $X$ with probability density
function (pdf) given by:
ac a
f X ( x ) = a + 1 , x ≥ c
x
where $a > 0$ and $c > 0$ are the parameters of the distribution.
ac

a − 1
\item  Show that the expected value of X is E [ X ] =
\item  Verify that the cumulative distribution function of X is given by

⎛ c ⎞
F X ( x ) = 1 − ⎜ ⎟ ,
⎝ x ⎠
%%--- CT3 A2010—4
x ≥ c
(and = 0 for x < c).
[2]Suppose that for the distribution of claim sizes X it is known that $c = 2.5$, but a is
unknown and needs to be estimated given a random sample x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n .
\item 
(iv)
Show that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of a is given by:
n
a ˆ = n
.
⎛ x i ⎞
∑ log ⎜ ⎝ 2.5 ⎟ ⎠
i = 1
\item Derive the asymptotic variance of the MLE â , and hence determine its
approximate asymptotic distribution.


\item Consider a sample of 30 observations from this distribution, for which:
30
∑ log( x i ) = 32.9 .
i = 1
(v)
\item Calculate the MLE â in this case, together with an approximate 95%
confidence interval for a.

In the current year, claim sizes are assumed to follow the distribution of X with a = 6,
c = 2.5. Inflation for the following year is expected to be 5%.
(vi)
\item Calculate the probability that the size of a claim arising from this portfolio in
the following year will exceed £4,000.

(iii) As expected the means are the same,
but the standard deviation in (i) is larger than that in (ii) due to the fact that
both N and X have larger variances.
