Let X 1 , X 2 , ... , X n be a random sample of claim amounts which are modelled using a
gamma distribution with known parameter $\alpha = 4$ and unknown parameter $\lambda$ .
n
\item 
(a)
Specify the distribution of
∑ X i .
i = 1
(b)
Justify the fact that 2n \lambda X has a \chi^2 k distribution, where X is the mean of the sample, by using a suitable relationship between the gamma and the \chi^2 distribution, and specify the degrees of freedom k.

\begin{itemize}
\item (i)
(a) Σ X i ~ gamma(4 n , \lambda)
(b) If Y ~ gamma(\alpha, \lambda) and 2\alpha is an integer, then 2 \lambda Y ~ \chi^22 \alpha (from book
of formulae, p12)
So 2 \lambda nX ~ \chi^2 with df 8 n .
\item (ii)
P ( \chi^2 40 (97.5) < 10 \lambda X < \chi^2 40 (2.5)) = 0.95
