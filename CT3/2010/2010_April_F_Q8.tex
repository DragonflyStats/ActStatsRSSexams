\item For a sample of 100 insurance policies the following frequency distribution gives the
number of policies, f, which resulted in x claims during the last year:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}
x:   & f:
0    & 76
1    & 22
2     & 1
3    & 1
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 
Calculate the sample mean, standard deviation and coefficient of skewness for these data on the number of claims per policy.
A Poisson model has been suggested as appropriate for the number of claims per policy.
\item 
(a) State the value of the estimated parameter when a Poisson distribution is fitted to these data using the method of maximum likelihood.
\item (b) Verify that the coefficient of skewness for the fitted model is 1.92, and hence comment on the shape of the frequency distribution relative to that of the corresponding fitted Poisson distribution.
\end{enumerate}

(i)
$\sum f = 100$, $\sum  fx = 27$, $\sum fx^2 = 35$
\[x =
27
= 0.27
100
1
27 2\]
\[
s = {35 -
} = 0.2799 ∴ s = 0.529
99
100
2\]
\begin{itemize}
\item Third moment about mean is
\[m 3 =
1
{76(0 - 0.27) 3 + 22(1 - 0.27) 3 + (2 - 0.27) 3 + (3 - 0.27) 3 } = 0.3259\]
100\]
\item [OR: using Σ fx 3 = 57, m 3 =
1
\[{57 - 3(0.27)(35) + 2(100)(0.27) 3 } \]
100
\item So coefficient of skewness is
\[0.3259
(0.2799) 3/2
= 2.20\]
\item [OR: can use m 2 = 0.2771 in denominator to give 2.23 ]

\end{itemize}

(ii)
(a) $\hat{\mu}  = \bar{x} = 0.27$
(b) Coefficient of skewness is
1
= 1.92 (from book of formulae, p7)
0.27
so, the data distribution is slightly more positively skewed than the fitted Poisson.
