\begin{itemize}
    \item The random variable X has a Poisson distribution with mean Y, where Y itself is
considered to be a random variable. 
\item The distribution of Y is lognormal with
parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ .
\item Derive the unconditional mean $E[X]$ and variance $V[X]$ using appropriate conditional
moments. (You may use any standard results without proof, including results from
the book of Formulae and Tables.)
\end{itemize}
