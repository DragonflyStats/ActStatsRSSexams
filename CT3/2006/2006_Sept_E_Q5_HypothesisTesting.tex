\noindent 
In a random sample of 200 policies from a company's private motor business, there are 68 female policyholders and 132 male policyholders.
Let the proportion of policyholders who are female in the corresponding population of all policyholders be denoted .
Test the hypotheses
\[H 0 : P \geq 0.4 v H 1 :
 p < 0.4\]
stating clearly the approximate probability value of the observed statistic and your conclusion.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{Question 5}
\begin{itemize}
\item Under $H_0$ : sample proportion P is approximately normally distributed with mean 0.4 and standard error 
\[ \sqrt{ \frac{0.4 \times 0.6}{200}} \;=;\ \sqrt{ \frac{0.24}{200}} ;\=;\ 0.0464\]
\item Therefore P-value of observed proportion (68/200 = 0.4)
0.4 − 0.4 ⎞
⎛
= P ⎜ Z <
⎟ = P ( Z < − 1.72 ) = 0.042
0.0464 ⎠
⎝
\item We reject $H_0$ at the 5\% level of testing and conclude that the proportion of
policyholders who are female is less than 0.4.
\item [OR This is actually better - working with the number of female policyholders
(observed = 68), the P-value is
⎛
⎞
68.5 − 80
P ⎜ Z <
= − 1.660 ⎟ = 0.048
⎜
⎟
200(0.4)(0.6)
⎝
⎠
]
\item Note: We can word the conclusion: we reject $H_0$ at levels of testing down to 4.2\% (or
4.8\%) and conclude ...
\end{itemize}
