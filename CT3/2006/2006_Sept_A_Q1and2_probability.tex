\item A bag contains 8 black and 6 white balls. Two balls are drawn out at random, one
after the other and without replacement.
Calculate the probabilities that:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The second ball drawn out is black.
\item The first ball drawn out was white, given that the second ball drawn out is
black.
\end{enumerate}

%% -- Question 2
\item
Let A and B denote independent events.
Show that A and B , the complement of event B, are also independent events.

(i)
\[P (second ball drawn is B ) = P (first ball drawn is B ) = 8/14 = 0.571\]
OR P (1 st B and 2 nd B ) + P (1 st W and 2 nd B )
= (8/14) × (7/1) + (6/14) \times (8/1) = 8/14
(ii)

\begin{eqnarray*}
P (1 st W | 2 nd B ) &=& \frac{P (1 st W and 2 nd B )}{ P (2 nd B )} \\  
&=& \frac{ (6/14) \times (8/1) }{ (8/14) } \\
&=& \frac{6}{14} \\  &=& 0.462\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{itemize}
\item Since A and B are independent, $P ( A ) = P ( A | B ) = P ( A | B )$
(
Noting that ( B ) = B , it follows immediately that $P ( A ) = P ( A | B ) = P A | ( B )$
)
and so A and B are independent.
\item [OR
Since A and B are independent P (A \cap B) = P(A)P(B).
\item Thus,
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A \cap B ) &=& P(A) − P(A \cap B) \\ 
&=& P(A) − P(A)P(B) \\ &=& P(A){1 − P(B)} \\ &=& P(A)P( B )
\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\item Therefore A and B are independent.
\end{itemize}
