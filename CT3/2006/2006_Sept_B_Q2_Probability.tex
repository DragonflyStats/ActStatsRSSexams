%% -- Question 2

\noindent Let A and B denote independent events.
Show that A and B , the complement of event B, are also independent events.

\begin{itemize}
\item Since A and B are independent, $P ( A ) = P ( A | B ) = P ( A | B )$
\item (
Noting that ( B ) = B , it follows immediately that $P ( A ) = P ( A | B ) = P A | ( B )$
)
and so A and B are independent.
\item [OR
Since A and B are independent P (A \cap B) = P(A)P(B).
\item Thus,
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A \cap B ) &=& P(A) − P(A \cap B) \\ 
&=& P(A) − P(A)P(B) \\ &=& P(A){1 − P(B)} \\ &=& P(A)P( B )
\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\item Therefore A and B are independent.
\end{itemize}
