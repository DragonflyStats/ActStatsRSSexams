In a one-way analysis of variance, in which samples of 10 claim amounts (Â£) from
each of three different policy types are being compared, the following means were
calculated:
y 1
276.7 ,
y 2
254.6 ,
y 3
296.3
with residual sum of squares SS R given by

SS R
( y ij

Calculate estimates for each of the parameters in the usual mathematical model, that
is, calculate , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 2 .
