%-Question 3
\item 
Consider 12 independent insurance policies, numbered $\{1, 2, 3, , 12\}$, for each of which a maximum of 1 claim can occur. For each policy, the probability of a claim
occurring is 0.1.
Find the probability that no claims arise on the group of policies numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, and exactly 1 claim arises in total on the group of policies numbered 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.

%%--- Question 3
\begin{itemize}
\item P(no claims on 6 policies) = 0.5314 (from tables p186 — or using 0.9 6 )
\item P(1 claim on 6 policies) = 0.8857 − 0.5314 = 0.3543 (or using 6(0.1)(0.9 5 ))
\item So required probability = 0.5314 × 0.3543 = 0.188.
\end{itemize}
