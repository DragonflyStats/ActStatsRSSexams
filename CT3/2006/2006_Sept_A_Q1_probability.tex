\noindent A bag contains 8 black and 6 white balls. Two balls are drawn out at random, one
after the other and without replacement.
Calculate the probabilities that:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The second ball drawn out is black.
\item The first ball drawn out was white, given that the second ball drawn out is
black.
\end{enumerate}

(i)
\[P (second ball drawn is B ) = P (first ball drawn is B ) = 8/14 = 0.571\]
OR P (1 st B and 2 nd B ) + P (1 st W and 2 nd B )
= (8/14) Ã— (7/1) + (6/14) \times (8/1) = 8/14
(ii)

\begin{eqnarray*}
P (1 st W | 2 nd B ) &=& \frac{P (1 st W and 2 nd B )}{ P (2 nd B )} \\  
&=& \frac{ (6/14) \times (8/1) }{ (8/14) } \\
&=& \frac{6}{14} \\  &=& 0.462\\
\end{eqnarray*}
