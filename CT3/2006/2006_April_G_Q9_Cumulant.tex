\begin{enumerate}
\item 
The total claim amount on a portfolio, S, is modelled as having a compound
distribution
S = X 1 + X 2 +
+ X N
where N is the number of claims and has a Poisson distribution with mean , $X_i$ is the amount of the i th claim, and the X i s are independent and identically distributed and
independent of N. Let $M_X (t)$ denote the moment generating function of X i .
\begin{enumerate}
\item (i)
Show, using a conditional expectation argument, that the cumulant generating function of S, $C_S (t)$, is given by
C S (t) =
M X (t) 1}.
Note: You may quote the moment generating function of a Poisson random variable from the book of Formulae and Tables.
\item 
(ii)
Calculate the variance of S in the case where
variance 10.

\begin{enumerate}
\item (i)
M S (t) = E[e tS ] = E[E[e tS |N]]
Now E[e tS |N = n] = E[exp(tX 1 +
+ tX n )] = E[exp(tX i )] = {M X (t)} n
M S (t) = E[{M X (t)} N ] = E[exp{NlogM X (t)}] = M N {logM X (t)}
= exp[ M X (t) 1}] since N ~ Poisson( )
C S (t) = logM S (t) = M X (t) 1}
\item (ii)
V[S] = C S (0) =
M X (0)} = E[X 2 ] = 20(10 + 20 2 ) = 8200
OR V[S] = E[N]V[X] + V[N]{E[X]} 2 = 20 10 + 20 20 2 = 8200
