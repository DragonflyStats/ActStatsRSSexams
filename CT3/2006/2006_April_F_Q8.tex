The events that lead to potential claims on a policy arise as a Poisson process at a rate
of 0.8 per year. However the policy is limited such that only the first three claims in
any one year are paid.

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
(i) Determine the probabilities of 0, 1, 2 and 3 claims being paid in a particular
year.

\item 
(ii) The amounts (in units of \$100) for the claims paid follow a gamma
distribution with parameters = 2 and = 1.
Calculate the expectation of the sum of the amounts for the claims paid in a
particular year.

\item (iii)
9
Calculate the expectation of the sum of the amounts for the claims paid in a
particular year, given that there is at least one claim paid in the year.


\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (i)
April 2006
 
By subtraction using entries in tables for Poisson(0.8), the probabilities for the Poisson distribution for 0, 1, 2 and 3 are: [or by evaluation]
0.44933, 0.35946, 0.14379 and (1 0.95258) = 0.04742
\item (ii)
Let N = number of claims paid and let X 1 ,
S = X i is the sum of the amounts.
, X n be the claim amounts then
E[S] = E[N]E[X]
Here E[N] = 1(0.35946) + 2(0.14379) + 3(0.04742) = 0.7893
and E[X] = 2/1 = 2 from gamma(2,1)
So E[S] = (0.7893)(2) = 1.5786 = \$157.86
\item (iii)
Given that N > 0, divide the probabilities in part (i) by (1 0.44933) =
0.55067 to give the probabilities for 1, 2 and 3 claims paid as:
0.6528, 0.2611 and 0.0861
E[N] = 1(0.6528) + 2(0.2611) + 3(0.0861) = 1.4333
So E[S] = (1.4333)(2) = 2.8666 = \$286.66
