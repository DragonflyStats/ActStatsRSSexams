One variable of interest, T, in the description of a physical process can be modelled as
T = XY where X and Y are random variables such that X ~ N(200, 100) and Y depends on X in such a way that Y|X = x ~ N(x, 1).
Simulate two observations of T, using the following pairs of random numbers (observations of a uniform (0, 1) random variable), explaining your method and
calculations clearly:
Random numbers
0.5714 , 0.8238
0.3192 , 0.6844

\item 7
Let (X 1 , X 2 , , X n ) be a random sample from a uniform distribution on the interval
( , ), where is an unknown positive number.
A particular sample of size 5 gives values 0.87, 0.43, 0.12, 0.92, and 0.58.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \item (i) Draw a rough graph of the likelihood function L( ) against
\item \item (ii) State the value of the maximum likelihood estimate of . for this sample.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

n
for
< x i < , i = 1, 2,
, n and L( ) = 0 otherwise
So, as increases from zero, L( ) is zero until it reaches the largest
observation in absolute value i.e. max |x i |, i = 1, 2, , n. For the data given,
this value is 0.92.
It is then a decreasing function . Hence the graph is as below:
6
0
0
\item (ii)
0.92
The maximum value of L( ) is attained at the largest absolute value of the
data. The ML estimate of is 0.92.
