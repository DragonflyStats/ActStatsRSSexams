%%- Quesiton  6
A large portfolio of policies is such that a proportion p (0 < p < 1) incurred claims
during the last calendar year. An investigator examines a randomly selected group of
25 policies from the portfolio.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Use a Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution to calculate an approximate value for the probability that there are at most 4 policies with
claims in the two cases where (a) p = 0.1 and (b) p = 0.2.
\item Comment briefly on the above approximations, given that the exact values of
the probabilities in part(i), using the binomial distribution, are 0.9020 and
0.4207 respectively.
\end{enumerate}
