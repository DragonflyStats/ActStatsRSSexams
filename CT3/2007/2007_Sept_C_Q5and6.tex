\item For a particular insurance company a sample of eight claim amounts (in units of
8
\$1,000) on household contents is taken. The data give
$\sum  X_{i} = 56.7$ and
i = 1
8
$$\sum  X_{i} 2 = 403.95$ .
The claim amounts are assumed to follow a normal distribution.
i = 1
6
\begin{enumerate}
\item (i) Calculate a 90\% confidence interval for the true mean claim amount.
\item (ii) Use the confidence interval calculated in (i) above to comment on an expert’s
assessment that the average claim amount for the company is \$6,500.
\end{enumerate}

%%-- [Total 4]
In an investigation into the relationship between two normally distributed variables, X
and Y, based on a sample of 15 points, it is desired to perform the following test
concerning the true underlying correlation coefficient $\rho$
\[H 0 : \rho = 0 v H 1 : \rho > 0.\]
Use the t distribution to determine an upper critical value for the sample correlation
coefficient r for this test at the 1% level.

\begin{itemize}
\item The value \$6500 is not included in the CI above, and therefore we conclude
that the data are not consistent with the expert’s assessment at the 10%
significance level.
\item Use the result
r n − 2
1 − r 2
~ t n − 2 under H 0 .
\item From tables t 0.01,13 = 2.650
so critical value is solution of
r

13 = 2.65

\item From the Yellow Book:
\item Mean:
\[E(S) = E(N)E(X) = (20)(10000) = \$200,000\]
\item Variance: 
\begin{eqnarray*}var(S) &=& E(N) var(X) + var(N)[E(X)]^2\\
&=& 20(2000 2 ) + 20(10000 2 ) \\ &=& 2080 × 10^6\\
\end{eqnarray*}

∴ Standard deviation = \$45607
\item [ OR , using compound Poisson results (in Yellow Book)
E(S) = λm 1 and var(S) = λm 2 where λ = E(N) and m r = E(X r )]
