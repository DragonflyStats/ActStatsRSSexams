\begin{enumerate}

\item It is assumed that claims on a certain type of policy arise as a Poisson process with
claim rate λ per year.
For a group of 150 independent policies of this type, the total number of claims during
the last calendar year was recorded as 123.
Determine an approximate 95\% confidence interval for the true underlying annual
claim rate for such a policy.
