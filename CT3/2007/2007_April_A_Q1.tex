\item Consider the following two random samples of ten observations which come from the
distributions of random variables which assume non-negative integer values only.
Sample 1: 7 4 6 11 5 9 8 3 5 5
sample mean = 6.3, sample variance = 6.01
Sample 2: 8 3 5 11 2 4 6 12 3 9
sample mean = 6.3, sample variance = 12.46
One sample comes from a Poisson distribution, the other does not.
State, with brief reasons, which sample you think is likely to be which.

\begin{itemize}
    \item A Poisson random variable has mean = variance and this will be reflected in the
sample mean and variance for a random sample.
\item Sample 2 has a very much higher variance than mean, whereas sample 1 has mean
and variance approximately the same, so sample 1 is likely to be the one which comes
from a Poisson distribution.
\end{itemize}
