%%- Question 6
Consider the discrete random variable $X$ with probability function
\[f ( x ) =
(i)
4
5 x + 1
,
x = 0, 1, 2, ...\]
Show that the moment generating function of the distribution of $X$ is given by
\[M_X ( t ) = 4(5 − e t ) − 1 ,\]
for e t < 5.
(ii)

Determine $E[X]$ using the moment generating function given in part (i).
