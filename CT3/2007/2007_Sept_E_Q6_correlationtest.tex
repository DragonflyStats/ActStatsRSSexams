In an investigation into the relationship between two normally distributed variables, X
and Y, based on a sample of 15 points, it is desired to perform the following test
concerning the true underlying correlation coefficient $\rho$
\[H 0 : \rho = 0 v H 1 : \rho > 0.\]
Use the t distribution to determine an upper critical value for the sample correlation
coefficient r for this test at the 1% level.

\begin{itemize}

\item Use the result
r n − 2
1 − r 2
~ t n − 2 under H 0 .
\item From tables t 0.01,13 = 2.650
so critical value is solution of
r
1 − r 2
13 = 2.65
2.65 2
13
= 0.592
\item Solving gives r =
2.65 2

\item From the Yellow Book:
\item Mean:
\[E(S) = E(N)E(X) = (20)(10000) = \$200,000\]
\item Variance: 
\begin{eqnarray*}var(S) &=& E(N) var(X) + var(N)[E(X)]^2\\
&=& 20(2000 2 ) + 20(10000 2 ) \\ &=& 2080 × 10^6\\
\end{eqnarray*}

∴ Standard deviation = \$45607
\item [ OR , using compound Poisson results (in Yellow Book)
E(S) = λm 1 and var(S) = λm 2 where λ = E(N) and m r = E(X r )]
\end{itemize}
