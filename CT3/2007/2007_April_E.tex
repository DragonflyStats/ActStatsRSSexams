A random sample of insurance policies of a certain type was examined for each of
four insurance companies and the sums insured ( y ij , for companies i = 1, 2, 3, 4)
under each policy are given in the table below (in units of £100):

∑ i ∑ j y ij = 871.9 and ∑ i ∑ j y ij 2 = 47, 633.53Consider the ANOVA model Y ij = μ + τ i + e ij , i = 1,..., 4, j = 1,..., n i , where Y ij is the j th
sum insured for company i , n i is the number of responses for company i ,

\item (i) Calculate estimates of the parameters μ and τ i , i = 1, 2, 3, 4 .
\item (ii) Test the hypothesis that there are no differences in the means of the sums
insured under such policies by the four companies.

The number of claims, X , which arise in a year on each policy of a particular class is to be modelled as a Poisson random variable with mean \lambda. Let X = ( X 1 , X 2 , ..., X n ) be
1 n
a random sample of size n from the distribution of X , and let X = ∑ X i .
n i = 1
Suppose that it is required to estimate \lambda , the mean number of claims on a policy.
\item (i) Show that \lambdâ , the maximum likelihood estimator of \lambda, is given by \hat{\lambda} = X . 
\item (ii) Derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRlb) for the variance of unbiased estimators of \lambda.
\item (iii)

(a) Show that \lambdâ is unbiased for \lambda and that it attains the CRlb.
(b) Explain clearly why, in the case that n is large, the distribution of \lambdâ can be approximated by
⎛ \lambda ⎞
\hat{\lambda} ~ N ⎜ \lambda , ⎟ .
⎝ n ⎠

(iv)
(a)
Show that, in the case n = 100, an approximate 95\% confidence interval for \lambda is given by
x \pm 0.196 x .
(b)
Evaluate the confidence interval in (iv)(a) based on a sample with the

At the 5\% significance level, F 0.05,3,12 = 3.490 (or F 0.01,3,12 = 5.953 )
Since F = 9.763 > 3.490, there is evidence against the null hypothesis, and we conclude that there are differences in the mean sums insured by the companies.
