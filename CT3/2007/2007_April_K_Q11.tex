\begin{document}
The number of claims, X , which arise in a year on each policy of a particular class is to be modelled as a Poisson random variable with mean \lambda. Let X = ( X 1 , X 2 , ..., X n ) be
1 n
a random sample of size n from the distribution of X , and let X = ∑ X i .
n i = 1
Suppose that it is required to estimate \lambda , the mean number of claims on a policy.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Show that $\hat{\lambdâ}$, the maximum likelihood estimator of $\lambda$, is given by $\hat{\lambda} = X $. 
\item Derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRlb) for the variance of unbiased estimators of $\lambda$.
\item 

(a) Show that \lambdâ is unbiased for \lambda and that it attains the CRlb.
(b) Explain clearly why, in the case that n is large, the distribution of \lambdâ can be approximated by
⎛ \lambda ⎞
\hat{\lambda} ~ N ⎜ \lambda , ⎟ .
⎝ n ⎠

(iv)
(a)
Show that, in the case $n = 100$, an approximate 95\% confidence interval for $\lambda$ is given by
x \pm 0.196 x .
(b)
\end{enumerate}
Evaluate the confidence interval in (iv)(a) based on a sample with the
following composition:
