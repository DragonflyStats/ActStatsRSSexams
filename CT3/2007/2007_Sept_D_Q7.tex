Let N denote the number of claims which arise in a portfolio of business and let $X_{i}$ be
the amount of the ith claim. Let each of the $X_{i}$ ’s be independently modelled as a
normal variable with mean £10,000 and standard deviation £2,000 and let N be
independently modelled as a Poisson variable with parameter 20.
Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the total claim amount $S = X_1 + \ldots +X_N$ .

\begin{itemize}
\item From the Yellow Book:
\item Mean:
\[E(S) = E(N)E(X) = (20)(10000) = \$200,000\]
\item Variance: 
\begin{eqnarray*}\operatorname{Var}(S) &=& E(N) \operatorname{Var}(X) + \operatorname{Var}(N)[E(X)]^2\\
&=& 20(2000 2 ) + 20(10000 2 ) \\ &=& 2080 × 10^6\\
\end{eqnarray*}

∴ Standard deviation = \$45607
\item [ OR , using compound Poisson results (in Yellow Book)
$E(S) = \lambda m 1$ and $\operatorname{Var}(S) = \lambda m 2$ where $\lambda = E(N)$ and $m r = E(X r )$
