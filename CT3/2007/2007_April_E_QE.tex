%%-Question 5
\item 
The number of claims arising in one year from a group of policies follows a Poisson
distribution with mean 12. The claim sizes independently follow an exponential distribution with mean \$80 and they are independent of the number of claims. The current financial year has six months remaining.
Calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the total claim amount which arises during this remaining six months.

5
\begin{itemize}
\item Let N = number of claims in the six months
\itemLet X = a single claim size
\item Let S = sum of claim sizes for the six months
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Then N ~ Poisson(6)
\[E ( S ) = E ( N ) E ( X ) = (6)(80) = £480\]
V ( S ) = E ( N ) V ( X ) + V ( N )[ E ( X )] 2 = (6)(80 2 ) + (6)(80 2 ) = 76800
∴ sd ( S ) = £277
