\item It is known that 24\% of the customers in a bank holding a current account also have another type of account with the bank.
Calculate an approximate value for the probability that fewer than 50 customers in a random sample of 250 customers with a current account also have another type of
account.

Let N be the number who have another type of account.
∴ N ~ binomial(250, 0.24) ≈ N (60, 45.6) = N (60, 6.753 2 )
P ( N < 50) → P ( N < 49.5) with continuity correction
