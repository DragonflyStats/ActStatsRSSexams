In a laboratory experiment a response variable (yield, y) is thought to be affected by a
quantitative factor (percentage of catalyst, x). The experiment involved making four
observations of y at each of four values of x, being 12%, 14%, 16% and 18%, and
resulted in the following observed response data.

These data are analysed by two statisticians, A and B, who use an analysis of variance
approach and a linear regression approach, respectively.
(i)
Statistician A’s approach:
You are given the following data summaries:
sub-totals \sigma_y = 186, 236, 243 and 207 at x = 12, 14, 16 and 18,
respectively, and overall totals \sigma_y = 872 and \sigma_y 2 = 48,196.
(a) Apply a one-way analysis of variance to these data and obtain the
resulting F-value for the usual test.
(b) Show that the P-value for the test is substantially less than 0.01, by
referring to tables of percentage points for the F distribution.
(c) The result of part (b) above shows that there is very strong evidence of
an effect on y due to the quantitative factor x. Suggest a suitable
diagram that statistician A could now use to describe the effect of x on
y. Draw this diagram and hence comment on the effect of x on y.
(d) The graph below shows the residuals plotted against the values of x:
Comment briefly on any implications of this graph.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%(ii)
Statistician B’s approach:
You are given the following data summaries:
\sigma x = 240 \sigma_y = 872 \sigma x 2 = 3,680 \sigma_y 2 = 48,196 \sigma xy = 13,150.
(a) Perform a linear regression analysis on these data to show that the
fitted line is given by y = 41.4 + 0.875x.
(b) Perform the hypothesis test on the slope coefficient
H 0 : \beta = 0 v H 1 : \beta ≠ 0
showing that the P-value is greater than 0.20.
Comment on what this implies about the relationship between x and y.
(c)
The graph below shows the residuals plotted against the values of x:
Comment briefly on what this graph implies about the effect of x on y.
(d)
Suggest an additional analysis statistician B could now use to describe
the effect of x on y.

SS T = 48196 – 872 2 /16 = 48196 – 47524 = 672
SS B = (186 2 + 236 2 + 243 2 + 207 2 )/4 – 47524 = 523.5
SS R = 672 – 523.5 = 148.5
F =

= 14.10
148.5 /12 12.375
[or construct an ANOVA table]
(b)
F 3,12 (1%) = 5.953 from tables
since 14.10 >> 5.953, P-value << 0.01
(c)
Statistician A could plot either the individual y values or the four
means of y against x to see what “shape” the effect might take.
Here is a plot of the individual y values:

The shape of the effect seems to be curved, initially increasing, then
decreasing.

The implications are simply that there is nothing to invalidate the
assumptions required for the analysis.

P-value = 2 × P(t 14 >1.185)
As P(t 14 >1.345) = 0.10 from tables, P-value > 2(0.10), i.e. > 0.20
This implies that there is no evidence against H 0 , and hence that there
is no linear relationship between x and y.
[not that there is no “relationship”]
(c) Residual plot suggests that there may be a curved, rather than linear,
relationship between x and y.
(d) Statistician B could try a quadratic regression (or some other curved
form) of y on x.
