As part of an investigation into health service funding a working party was concerned
with the issue of whether mortality rates could be used to predict sickness rates. Data
on standardised mortality rates and standardised sickness rates were collected for a
sample of 10 regions and are shown in the table below:
Region Mortality rate m (per 10,000) Sickness rate s (per 1,000)

Data summaries:
m = 1136.1,
(i)
m 2 = 129,853.03, s = 1934.2,
s 2 = 377,700.62, ms = 221,022.58
Calculate the correlation coefficient between the mortality rates and the
sickness rates and determine the probability-value for testing whether the
underlying correlation coefficient is zero against the alternative that it is
positive.
[4]
(ii) Noting the issue under investigation, draw an appropriate scatterplot for these
data and comment on the relationship between the two rates.
[3]
(iii) Determine the fitted linear regression of sickness rate on mortality rate and test
whether the underlying slope coefficient can be considered to be as large
as 2.0.
[5]
(iv) For a region with mortality rate 115.0, estimate the expected sickness rate and
calculate 95% confidence limits for this expected rate.

Given the issue of whether mortality can be used to predict sickness, we
require a plot of sickness against mortality:
There seems to be an increasing linear relationship such that mortality could
be used to predict sickness.
