A marketing consultant was commissioned to conduct a questionnaire survey of the
clients of a financial company. The total number of respondents was 650, of whom
220 had investments above a specified threshold.
(i)
Each respondent who had investments above the threshold was asked about
the percentage of these investments that was held in the form of a certain type
of trust. The respondents answered by ticking appropriate boxes and the
results led to the following frequency distribution.

(a) Present these data graphically using a carefully drawn histogram.
(b) Calculate the mean percentage for the full set of 220 such respondents,
assuming that the frequencies in each category are uniformly spread
over the corresponding range.
[5]
Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the percentage of such investors who
would have investments above the threshold.
[4]
The same respondents with investments referred to in part (i) were also asked to
specify their satisfaction with the current return received from their full portfolio of
investment. This was in the form of a four-point qualitative scale: very satisfied, quite
satisfied, a little disappointed, very disappointed. The following two-way table of
frequencies was obtained.

In order to investigate whether there is any relationship between the percentage in
such trusts and satisfaction with current return, a 2 test is to be performed.
(iii) Calculate the expected frequencies for the above table under an appropriate
hypothesis (which should be stated) and comment on why it would be
inappropriate to carry out a 2 test directly with these data.
[3]
(iv) Combining the very satisfied and quite satisfied categories together and
the a little disappointed and very disappointed categories together results
in the following reduced two-way table.

The key feature of the histogram is that the areas of the four rectangles
should be proportional to the frequencies.

relationship between percentage in type of trust and satisfaction with current
return.
However this decision to accept is marginal at the 5% level and there is some
evidence, but not strong, to suggest that satisfaction improves as the
percentage increases.
