A scientific investigation involves a linear regression with the usual assumptions that
the response variable y follows a normal distribution with mean α + β x and variance
σ 2 . Twenty data points were recorded, corresponding to four observations of y at
x = 1, three observations of y at x = 2, six observations of y at x = 3, and seven
observations of y at x = 4. The resulting means of these sets of y observations are
given in the table below.

(i) Determine the fitted regression line of y on x.
(ii) Suppose that you have been asked to provide a 95% confidence interval for
the slope coefficient.

(a) Comment briefly on any problems you might encounter in the
computation of the required confidence interval.
(b) Indicate briefly any further information that you would need in order
to overcome these problems.

We need to calculate the basics sums ∑x, ∑x 2, ∑y, ∑xy
n = 20
∑x = 4(1) + 3(2) + 6(3) + 7(4) = 56
∑x 2 = 4(12) + 3(22) + 6(32) + 7(42) = 182
∑y = 4(18.6) + 3(21.7) + 6(23.2) + 7(27.1) = 468.4
∑xy = 1(4)(18.6) + 2(3)(21.7) + 3(6)(23.2) + 4(7)(27.1) = 1381.0

Problem as we do not have the individual yi values, only means of sets
of them.

We would need these individual yi values (or the s.d. or
set).

So E[X|Y = 2] = 1(3/8) + 2(4/8) = 11/8 = 1.375 1Subject CT3 (Probability and Mathematical Statistics Core Technical) — September 2009 — Marking Schedule
