%%-Question 8
A random sample of 25 recent claim amounts in a general insurance context is taken from a population that you may assume is normally distributed. In units of \$1,000, the sample mean is x = 9.416 and the sample standard deviation is s = 2.105.
Calculate a 95\% one-sided upper confidence limit (that is, the upper limit k of a confidence interval of the form (0,k)) for the standard deviation of the claim amounts in the population.

8
Let $\sigma^2$ be the population variance.

\[ \frac{24S^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^{2}_{24} \]


\[P \left( \frac{24S^2}{\sigma^2} > 13.85 \right) = 0.95\]



\[P \left( \sigma^2 < \frac{24S^2}{13.85 }  \right) = 0.95\]


\[ k^2 =  \frac{24 \times (2.105)^2}{13.85 }  \right) = 7.678\]

Therefore $k=2.771$
so upper confidence limit for $\sigma$  is $2.771$ i.e. \$2771
(OR: CI is (0, 2.771) i.e. (0, \$2771)).
