 A random sample of size n is taken from an exponential distribution with parameter
$\lambda$, that is, with probability density function
\[f ( x ) = \lambda e −\lambda x ,
(i)
0 < x < \infty .\]
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Determine the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of $\lambda$ .

Claim sizes for certain policies are modelled using an exponential distribution with
parameter $\lambda$  . A random sample of such claims results in the value of the MLE of $\lambda$ as $\hat{\lambda} = 0.00124$ .
A large claim is defined as one greater than \$4,000 and the claims manager is particularly interested in p, the probability that a claim is a large claim.
(ii)\item 
Determine p̂ , the MLE of p, explaining why it is the MLE.
\end{enumerate}
