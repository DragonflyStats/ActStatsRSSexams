 Let X be a random variable with moment generating function $M_X (t)$ and cumulant generating function C X (t), and let Y = aX + b, where a and b are constants. Let $Y$ have moment generating function M Y (t) and cumulant generating function $C_Y (t)$.
\item (i) Show that C Y (t) = bt + C X (at).
\item (ii) Find the coefficient of skewness of Y in the case that $M X (t) = (1 – t) –2$ and
Y = 3X + 2 (you may use the fact that C Y ′′′ (0) = E[(Y − \mu  Y ) 3 ]).

\item (i)
\[M_{Y} (t) = E[e^{tY} ] = E[e^{t(aX+b)}] = e^{tb}E[e^{atX} ] = e^{bt}M_X (at)\]
\[C_Y (t) = \log M_{Y} (t) = bt + \log MX (at) = bt + CX (at)\]
\item (ii)
\[C_Y (t) = 2t + \log(1 – 3t)^{ –2} = 2t – 2\log(1 – 3t) \]

\[C_Y^{\prime} (t) = 2 + 6(1 – 3t)^{-1} , C_Y^{\prime \prime} (t) = 18(1 – 3t)^{ –2} , C_Y^{\prime \prime \prime} (t) = 108(1 – 3t)^{-3}\]


\[E[(Y - \mu_Y )^2] = C_Y^{\prime \prime }(0) = 18, \]
\[E[(Y - \mu_Y )^3] = C_Y^{\prime \prime \prime}(0) = 108\]

coefficient of skewness of Y 
\[Y = \left( \frac{108}{18} \right)^{3/2} = 2^{1/2} = 1.414\]
OR note that coefficient of skewness of Y = coefficient of skewness of $X$ and just work with X (some candidates may recognise X ~ Gamma(2,1) and
comment on the formula for coefficient of skewness (2/  ) given in the
Yellow Book).
