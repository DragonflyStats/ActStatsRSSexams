Two tickets are selected at random, one after the other and without replacement, from a group of six tickets, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item \item (i) Calculate the probability that the numbers on the selected tickets add up to 8.
\item 
\item (ii) Calculate the probability that the numbers on the selected tickets differ by
3 or more.
\end{enumerate}

\item (i)
With sample space {(i,j), i = 1, ..., 6, j = 1, ..., 6, j
i}
(that is, i is the number on the first ticket selected, j that on the second
selected) there are 30 equally likely outcomes.
Favourable outcomes are $(2,6), (3,5), (5,3), (6,2)$
so probability = 4/30 = 2/15 = 0.133
\item (ii)
2
Favourable outcomes are
\[(1,4), (4,1), (1,5), (5,1), (1,6), (6,1), (2,5), (5,2), (2,6), (6,2), (3,6), (6,3)\]
so probability = 12/30 = 0.4
2
OR: Use a sample space of size 15: {(i,j)} where i is smaller number selected,
j is larger.
Then event (i) has 2 favourable outcomes and event (ii) has 6.
