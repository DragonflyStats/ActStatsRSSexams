\item The variables $X_1 , X_2 , .\ldots, X_{40}$ give the size (in units of \$100) of each of 40 claims in a random sample of claims arising from damage to cars by vandals. The size of each claim is assumed to follow a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha = 4$ and $\lamnda = 0.5$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

and each is independent of all others. Let $\bar{X} =
\sum^{40}_{1} X_i$ be the random variable
40 i = 1
giving the mean size of such a sample.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 
State the approximate sampling distribution of $X$ and determine its parameters.
\item 
Determine approximately the median of $X$ .

$E[X i ] = 4/0.5 = 8$ and $Var[X i ] = 4/(0.5^2) = 16$ (or by noting $ X_i \sim \chi^2_{8}$ ).

approximately.
[Note: The exact distribution of X is Gamma(160,20)]
(ii)
The symmetry of the distribution gives: median ⎡ ⎣ X ⎤ ⎦ = mean ⎡ ⎣ X ⎤ ⎦ = 8,
i.e. \$800.
