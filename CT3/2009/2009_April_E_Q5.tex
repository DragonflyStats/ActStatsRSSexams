\begin{document}

The human resources department of a large insurance company currently estimates that 82\% of new employees recruited by their call centres will still be employed by the company after one year. A recent extension to the call centre business led to 280
new employees being recruited.

Calculate an approximate value for the probability that at least 240 of these new employees will still be employed by the company after one year.

Let X be the number still in employment after one year.
∴ \[X ~ bin (280, 0.82) ≈ N (229.6, 6.43 2 )\]
\[P ( X \geq 240) = P ( X > 239.5)\] applying a continuity correction
