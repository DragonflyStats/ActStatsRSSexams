Let X be a random variable with probability density function given by
\[f ( x ) = 2 x \theta − 2 ,
0 < x < \theta .\]
Find an unbiased estimator of $theta$ , based on a single observation of $X$.

\item A random sample of size n is taken from an exponential distribution with parameter
$\lambda$, that is, with probability density function
\[f ( x ) = \lambda e −\lambda x ,
(i)
0 < x <∞ .\]
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Determine the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of $\lambda$ .

Claim sizes for certain policies are modelled using an exponential distribution with
parameter $\lambda$  . A random sample of such claims results in the value of the MLE of $\lambda$  as
$\hat{\lambda} = 0.00124$ .
A large claim is defined as one greater than \$4,000 and the claims manager is
particularly interested in p, the probability that a claim is a large claim.
(ii)\item 
Determine p̂ , the MLE of p, explaining why it is the MLE.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{eqnarray*}
E ( X ) &=& 
\int^{\theta}_{0} x f ( x ) dx\\
&=& \int^{\theta}_{0} 2x^{2} \theta^{-2} dx\\
&=& \frac{2}{3} \theta^{-2} \left[ x^3 \right]^{\theta}_{0} \\
&=& \frac{2}{3} \theta \\ 
\end{eqnarray*}


Consider ${\displaystyle Z = \frac{3}{2}X }$

\[ E(Z) \;=\; \frac{3}{2} E(X) \;=\; \theta \] 

$Z$ is an unbiased estimator of $\theta$
