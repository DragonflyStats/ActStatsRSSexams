\item 
An analysis of variance investigation with samples of size eight for each of four
treatments results in the following ANOVA table.
%%- April 2009 Question 9 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
Source of variation	&	d.f. 	&	SS 	&	MSS	& F \\  \hline 
Between treatments	&	3	&	6716	&	2239 & 	\\ \hline 
Residual	&	28	&	3362	&	120	& \\ \hline 
Total 	&	31	&	10078	&		& \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item (i) Calculate the observed F statistic, specify an interval in which the resulting P-value lies, and state your conclusion clearly.
\item (ii) The four treatment means are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $ { \displastyle \bar{ y }_1 = 85.0 }$, 
\item $ { \displastyle \bar{ y }_2 = 66.5 }$, 
\item $ { \displastyle \bar{ y }_3 = 59.0 }$, 
\item $ { \displastyle \bar{ y }_4 = 95.5 }$.
\end{itemize}
(a) Calculate the least significant difference between pairs of means using a 5\% level.
(b) List the means in order, illustrate the non-significant pairs using suitable underlining, and comment briefly.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item (i)

\[ F = \frac{2239}{120} =  18.66 on 3,28 d.f.\]

from tables $F_{3,28} (1\%) = 4.568$
âˆ´ P-value < 0.01 or 0 < P-v < 0.01
So there is overwhelming evidence of a difference between the underlying treatment means.

\item (ii)
(a)
\begin{eqnarray*}
LSD &=& t_{28, (2.5\%)} \hat{\sigma}^2  \sqrt{ \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} } \\
&=& 2.048 120  \sqrt{ \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} } \\
&=& 11.2\\
\end{eqnarray*}



\itme (b) means in order
y 3. < y 2. < y 1. < y 4.
underlined thus:
Treatments 2 & 3 are separate from treatments 1 & 4 which have significantly higher means.
