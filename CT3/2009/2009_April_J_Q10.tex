\noindent For a group of policies the probability distribution of the total number of claims, $N$, arising during a period of one year is given by
\[P(N = 0) = 0.70, P(N = 1) = 0.15, P(N = 2) = 0.10, P(N = 3) = 0.05.\]
Each claim amount, X (in units of £1,000), follows a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha = 2$ and $\lambda = 0.1$ independently of each other claim amount and of the number of claims.
Calculate the expected value and the standard deviation of the total of the claim
amounts for a period of one year.

\[E ( N ) = 0.7(0) + 0.15(1) + 0.1(2) + 0.05(3) = 0.5\]
\[E ( N^2 ) = 0.7(0) + 0.15(1) + 0.1(4) + 0.05(9) = 1.00 \] 

\noindent Therefore \[\operatorname{Var} (N) = 1.00 − 0.5^2 = 0.75\]

Let S = total of the claim amounts.
\[E [ S ] = E (N) E (X) = (0.5)(20) = 10 ,\] i.e. \$10,000.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\operatorname{Var} [ S ] &=& E (N) \operatorname{Var} (X) + \operatorname{Var} (N) [ E ( X )] 2 \\
&=& (0.5)(200) + (0.75)(20)^2\\ 
&=& 400\\
\end{eqnarray*}


∴ sd ( S ) = 20 , i.e. \$20,000.
