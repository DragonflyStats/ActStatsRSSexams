%%- Question 2
\large
\noindent Consider three events A, B, and C for which A and C are independent, and B and C are
mutually exclusive. You are given the probabilities $P(A) = 0.3$, $P(B) = 0.5$, $P(C) = 0.2$
and $P(A\cap B) = 0.1$.


\noindent Find the probability that none of A, B, or C occurs.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{eqnarray*}
P ( A \cup B \cup C ) &=& P ( A ) \; +  \; P ( B ) \; +  \; P ( C ) \;-\;  \\ 
& &   P ( A \cap B ) \; -\; P ( A \cap C ) \;-\; P ( B \cap C ) \; +  \; \\ & & P ( A \cap B \cap C )\\
&=& 0.3 \; +  \; 0.5 \; +  \; 0.2 \;-\; 0.1 \;-\; (0.3 \times 0.2) \\
&=& 0.84\\
\end{eqnarray*}
%%-- (OR via a Venn diagram)
So P (none occur) = 1 \;-\; 0.84 = 0.16

%% 1
