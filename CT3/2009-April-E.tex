For a group of policies the probability distribution of the total number of claims, N,
arising during a period of one year is given by
P(N = 0) = 0.70, P(N = 1) = 0.15, P(N = 2) = 0.10, P(N = 3) = 0.05.
Each claim amount, X (in units of £1,000), follows a gamma distribution with parameters α = 2 and λ = 0.1 independently of each other claim amount and of the number of claims.
Calculate the expected value and the standard deviation of the total of the claim amounts for a period of one year.

The number of claims, X, which arise in a year on each policy of a particular class is to be modelled as a Poisson random variable with mean λ. Let X = (X 1 , X 2 , ..., X n ) be a random sample from the distribution of X, and let X =
1 n
∑ X i .
n i = 1

Use moment generating functions to show that

distribution with mean nλ.
(b) State, with a brief reason, whether or not the variable 2X 1 + 5 has a Poisson distribution.
(c) State, with a brief reason, whether or not X has a Poisson distribution in the case that n = 2.
(d) State the approximate distribution of X in the case that n is large.
[8]
An actuary is interested in the level of claims being experienced and wants in particular to test the hypotheses
H 0 : λ = 1 v H 1 : λ > 1 .
He decides to use a random sample of size n = 100 and the best (most powerful) available test. You may assume that this test rejects H 0 for x > k , for some constant k.
(ii)
(a) Show that the value of k for the test with level of significance 0.01 is k = 1.2326.
(b) Calculate the power of the test in part (ii)(a) in the case λ = 1.2 and then in the case λ = 1.5.
(c) Comment briefly on the values of the power of the test obtained in part
(ii)(b).

No
One reason is that E[2X 1 + 5] = 2λ + 5, which is not equal to V[2X 1 + 5] = 4λ
[Note: another obvious reason is that 2X 1 + 5 can only takes values 5,
7, 9, ... , not 0, 1, 2, 3,... ]

(c)
No
One reason is that E ⎣ ⎡ X ⎦ ⎤ = λ , which is not equal to V ⎡ ⎣ X ⎤ ⎦ = λ / 2
[Note: another obvious reason is that X can take values 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ... , which a Poisson variable cannot.]

k is such that P ( X > k | H 0 ) = 0.01 so

θ ˆ ≈ N ( θ , CRlb ) for large samples
and so an approximate 95% CI for θ is θ ˆ ± 1.96 CRlb

With θ = 0.775 the four probabilities are 0.69375, 0.05625, 0.05625, 0.19375 respectively
and the corresponding expected frequencies are 1040.625, 84.375, 84.375, 290.625.
∴χ 2 = ∑
( o − e ) 2
= 0.887 + 5.934 + 3.178 + 0.241 = 10.24 on 3 df
e
P-value = P ( χ 3 2 > 10.24) = 1 − 0.983 = 0.017
These data do not support the model with the value θ = 0.775 in that the probability of observing these data when θ = 0.775 is only 0.017.
[OR: could say “do not support at 5% level, but do support at 1% level”]
(b)
This is consistent with the fact that θ = 0.775 is well outside the approximate 95% CI.
