\begin{enumerate}

Let $X_1$ , $X_2$ , $X_3$ , $X_4$ , and $X_5$ be independent random variables, such that X i ~ gamma
5
with parameters i and \lambda for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Let $S = 2 \lambda \sum X_i$ .
i = 1
6
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item (i) Derive the mean and variance of S using standard results for the mean and variance of linear combinations of random variables.
\item
(ii) Show that S has a chi-square distribution using moment generating functions and state the degrees of freedom of this distribution.
\item 
(iii) Verify the values found in part (i) using the results of part (ii). .
\end{enumerate}

\begin{eqnarray*}
E(S) &=& 2 \lambda \sum^{5}_{i=1} \frac{i}{\lambda}\\

\begin{eqnarray*}

\[ M_X_{i} = \left( 1 \;-\; \frac{t}{\lambda} \right)^{-1} \]

\begin{eqnarray*}
M_{S}(t) &=& E[ \mbox{exp}(tS) ] \\
 &=& E[ \mbox{exp}\left(2 \lambda t \sum^{5}_{i=1}X_{i}\right) ] \\
 &=& \prod^{5}_{i=1} E[ \mbox{exp}\left(2 \lambda t X_{i}  \right)   ] \\
 &=& \prod^{5}_{i=1} M_X_{i} \left(2 \lambda t X_{i}  \right)    \\
 &=& \prod^{5}_{i=1} ( 1 \;-\; 2t)^{-i}\\
 &=& ( 1 \;-\; 2t)^{-15}\\

so S ~ χ 2 , with 30 df

χ 30
has mean 30 and variance 60 , as found in part (i).
