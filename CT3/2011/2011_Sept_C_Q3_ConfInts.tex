A random sample of 60 adult men who live in Leeds includes 21 who have visited Majorca. An independent random sample of 70 adult women who live in Leeds includes 28 who have visited Majorca.
Calculate a 98\% confidence interval for the proportion of adults who live in Leeds
who have visited Majorca.

Sample proportion = 49/130
Upper 1\% normal percentage point = 2.326

The 98\% Confidencce Interval is
\[49/130 \pm 2.326*[(49/130)(81/130)/130] 1/2\] i.e. \[0.3769 \pm 0.0989 \;=\; (0.278, 0.476)\]

%% Answers here were generally satisfactory. Some candidates erroneously computed CIs based
%% on men and women separately.
