\begin{document}
 The random variables X and Y are related as follows:
X conditional on Y = y has a N(2y, y 2 ) distribution.
Y has a N(200, 100) distribution.
Derive the unconditional variance of $X$, $\operatorname {Var} (Y)$.

\noindent The law of total variance, or conditional variance formulas, states that if X and Y are random variables on the same probability space, and the variance of Y is finite, then

\[  {\displaystyle \operatorname {Var} (Y)=\operatorname {E} [\operatorname {Var} (Y\mid X)]+\operatorname {Var} (\operatorname {E} [Y\mid X]).} \]

\begin{eqnarray*}
V[X]
&=& E[V(X|Y)] + V[E(X|Y)]\\
&=& E[Y 2 ] + V[2Y] \\ 
&=& (100 + 200 2 ) + 4\times 100 \\ 
&=& 40,500\\
\end{eqnarray*}
