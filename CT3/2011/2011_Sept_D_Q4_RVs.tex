\item The random variables X and Y are related as follows:
X conditional on Y = y has a N(2y, y 2 ) distribution.
Y has a N(200, 100) distribution.
Derive the unconditional variance of X, V[X].

\begin{eqnarray*}
V[X]
&=& E[V(X|Y)] + V[E(X|Y)]\\
&=& E[Y 2 ] + V[2Y] \\ 
&=& (100 + 200 2 ) + 4*100 \\ 
&=& 40,500\\
\end{eqnarray*}
%% Generally very well answered.
