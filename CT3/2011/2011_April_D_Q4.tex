%%- Question 4
Let $N$ be the random variable that describes the number of claims that an insurer receives per month for one of its claim portfolios. We assume that $N$ has a Poisson distribution with $E[N] = 50$. The amount $X_i$ of each claim in the portfolio is normally
distributed with mean $\mu = 1,000$ and variance $\sigma^2 = 200^2$ . The total amount of all
claims received during one month is

\[S = \sum^{N}_{i = 1} X_i\]

with $S = 0$ for $N = 0$. We assume that N, X 1 , X 2 , ... are all independent of each other.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Specify the type of the distribution of $S$.
\item Calculate the mean and standard deviation of $S$.
\end{enumerate}

(i) Compound Poisson distribution
(ii)
E[S] = 50 * 1000 = 50,000

\begin{eqnarray*}
V[S] &=& 50 * E[S 2 ] \\ &=& 50 * {V[X] + (E[X]) 2 } \\ &=& 50 * {200 2 + 1000 2 } \\ &=&
52,000,000\\
\end{eqnarray*}


SD[S] = 7,211.10
