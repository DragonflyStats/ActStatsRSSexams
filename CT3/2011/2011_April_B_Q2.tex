%%-Question 2
\large 
\noindent A random sample of size $n = 36$ has sample standard deviation $s = 7$.
Calculate, approximately, the probability that the mean of this sample is greater than
44.5 when the mean of the population is $\mu = 42$ .

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
⇒ P ( X > 44.5) ≈ P ( Z > 2.143) , where Z ~ N (0,1) ,
and from tables,
\[P ( X > 44.5) = 1 − 0.984 = 0.016\]
(A t 35 distribution can also be used if a normal distribution is assumed for the data.)
