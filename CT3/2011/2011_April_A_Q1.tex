%%--Question 1
\item The numbers of claims which have arisen in the last twelve years on 60 motor policies (continuously in force over this period) are shown (sorted) below:7
\begin{verbatim}
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 7
\end{verbatim}

Derive:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The sample median, mode and mean of the number of claims.
\item The sample inter-quartile range of the number of claims.
\item The sample standard deviation of the number of claims.
\end{enumerate}

1
\begin{itemize}
\item (i)
30 th and 31 st observations in order are both 2 ⇒ median = 2
mode = value with highest frequency = 1

\sum x = 1(14) + 2(11) + 3(10) + 4(5) + 5(4) + 6(3) + 7(1) = 131
⇒ mean = 131/60 = 2.18
\item (ii)
Lower quartile is 15.5 th observation counting from below = 1
Upper quartile is 15.5 th observation counting from above = 3
⇒ IQR = 2

\item (iii)
\sum x 2 = 1(14) + 4(11) + 9(10) + 16(5) + 25(4) + 36(3) + 49(1) = 485
⇒ standard deviation = [(485 – 131 2 /60)/59] 1/2 = 3.3726 1/2 = 1.84
\end{itemize}
