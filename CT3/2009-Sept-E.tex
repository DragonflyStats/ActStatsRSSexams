PLEASE TURN OVER11
Three insurance company colleagues had just completed an investigation which
involved the application of a two-sample t-test to compare two independent samples, each of size 11. They were concerned about the validity of the equal variance assumption required for this test. Their data were as follows.

(i)
One of the colleagues suggested a graphical approach for the comparison of the variances.
Draw a suitable diagram to represent these data so that the variability of the samples can be compared, and comment briefly on that comparison.
[3]
(ii)
(iii)
Another colleague suggested using an F-test for the comparison of variances.
(a) Perform this F-test at the 5% level to compare the variances and express your conclusion clearly.
(b) In addition obtain an approximate value of the P-value for this test by linearly interpolating between suitable entries in the tables.
[6]
The third colleague suggested another procedure using a two-sample t-test in the following way:
“For each sample calculate the absolute values of the deviations of the observations from the mean of that sample;
then apply a two-sample t-test to the two sets of absolute deviations.”
(a) Discuss the possible reasoning behind this suggested procedure by considering the potential values of such absolute deviations when the assumption of equal variances is valid and when it is not valid.
(b) (1) Calculate the required sets of absolute deviations for the given
data.
(2) Perform the suggested two-sample t-test at the 5\% level stating your conclusion clearly.
(3) Obtain, in addition, an approximate P-value for this test by linearly interpolating between suitable entries in the tables.

Comment briefly on the conclusions that may have been reached by the three
colleagues.

Dotplots on same scale are most suitable
[alternatively boxplots or histograms are acceptable]

The spread of the B data appears to be greater than that of the A data and so casts some doubt on the equal variance assumption.

For a two-sided test at the 5% level, critical value is
F 10,10(2.5%) = 3.717
So we accept H 0 :

F 10,10(2.5%) = 3.717 and F 10,10(5%) = 2.978
So P-value is between 0.05 and 0.10

By interpolation: P-value is
0.05

If the samples have equal variances, then the absolute deviations will be similar in size for both samples; if one sample has a larger variance than the other, then the deviations will be more extreme such that the
absolute deviations will be larger for that sample.
A two-sided two-sample t-test applied to these absolute deviations will test for a difference in the means of these absolute deviations and hence for a difference in the variances in the original samples.

For the two-sided test at the 5% level, critical value is
t 20(2.5%) = 2.086
So we just reject H 0 :

t 20(2.5\%) = 2.086 and t 20(1\%) = 2.528
So P-value is between 0.02 and 0.05

By interpolation: P-value is
0.02

(0.03) 0.02 (0.952)(0.03) 0.049

Tests in (ii) and (iii) give different results at the 5% level, but in fact have
quite similar P-values.
Graphical approach in (i) casts doubt on H 0 .
So all three are fairly consistent.
