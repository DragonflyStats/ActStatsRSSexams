A charity issues a large number of certificates each costing £10 and each being
repayable one year after issue. Of these certificates, 1% are randomly selected to
receive a prize of £10 such that they are repaid as £20. The remaining 99% are repaid
at their face value of £10.
(i)
Show that the mean and standard deviation of the sum repaid for a single
purchased certificate are £10.1 and £0.995 respectively.
[2]
Consider a person who purchases 200 of these certificates.
(ii)
Calculate approximately the probability that this person is repaid more than
£2,040 by using the Central Limit Theorem applied to the total sum repaid.
[3]
(iii)
An alternative approach to approximating the probability in (ii) above is based
on the number of prize certificates the person is found to hold. This number
will follow a binomial distribution.
Use a Poisson approximation to this binomial distribution to approximate the
probability that this person is repaid more than £2,040.
[3]
(iv)
Comment briefly on the comparison of the two approximations above given
that the exact probability using the binomial distribution is 0.0517.
