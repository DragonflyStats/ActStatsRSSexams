\begin{document}

Pressure readings are taken regularly from a meter. It transpires that, in a random
sample of 100 such readings, 45 are less than 1, 35 are between 1 and 2, and 20 are
between 2 and 3.
Perform a $\chi^2$ goodness of fit test of the model that states that the readings are
independent observations of a random variable that is uniformly distributed on (0, 3).

\chi^2 = [(45 – 100/3) 2 + (35 – 100/3) 2 + (20 – 100/3) 2 ]/(100/3) = 9.50 on 2df
P-value = P ( \chi^22 > 9.50) < 0.01
Reject model (at the 1% level of testing) as not providing a good fit to the data.
OR 5\% point of \chi^22 is 5.991, so we reject model at 5\%
OR 1% point of \chi^22 is 9.210, so we reject model at 1%
