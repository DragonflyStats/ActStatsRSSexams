\begin{enumerate}


A woodcutter has to cut 100 fence posts of a standard length and he has a metal bar of the required length to act as the standard. The woodcutter decides to vary his procedure from post to post − he cuts the first post using the metal standard, then uses
this post as his standard for the cut of the next post. He continues in a similar manner, each time using the most recently cut post as the standard for the next cut.

Each time the woodcutter cuts a post there is an error in the length cut relative to the
standard being employed for that cut − you should assume that the errors are independent observations of a random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 3mm.

Calculate, approximately, the probability that the length of the final post differs from the length of the original metal standard by more than 15mm.

Let L be the length of the metal bar and Z i be the error that arises at the i th cut.
\begin{itemize}
\item Length of 1 st post cut = L + Z 1
\item Length of 2 nd post cut = L + Z 1 + Z 2
\item Length of 100 th post cut = L + Z 1 + Z 2 + ... + Z 100
\item Error in length of last post cut is E = Z 1 + Z 2 + ... + Z 100
\item E ~ N(0,900) approximately, by CLT
\item P(|E| <15) ≈ P(|Z| < 15/30) = P(|Z| < 0.5) = 2 × 0.1915 = 0.383
So P(error exceeds 15mm) ≈ 1 – 0.383 = 0.617
