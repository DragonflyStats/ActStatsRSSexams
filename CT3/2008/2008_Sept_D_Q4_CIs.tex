\begin{document}
A random sample of 15 observations is taken from a normally distributed population
of values. The sample mean is 94.2 and the sample variance is 24.86.
Calculate a 99\% confidence interval for the population mean.

\begin{itemize}
\item Sample Variance $S^2$ = 24.86.
\item Therefore Sample Standard Deviation $S= \sqrt{24.86} = 4.986$
\item $t_{14} (0.005) = 2.977$
\item 99\% CI is $94.2 \pm 2.977 \frac{4.986}{\sqrt{15}}$$
\end{itemize}

i.e. $94.2 \pm 3.83 i.e. (90.37,98.03)$
