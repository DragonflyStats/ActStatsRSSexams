Suppose that the time $T$, measured in days, until the next claim arises under a portfolio of non-life insurance policies, follows an exponential distribution with mean 2.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Find the probability that no claim is made in the next one day period.
\item The median of a random variable is defined as the value for which the cumulative distribution function of the variable is equal to 0.5. Find the median time until the next claim arises.
\item 
Now let $T_1 , T_2 , \ldots , T_{30}$ be the times (in days) until the next claim arises under each one of 30 similar portfolios of non-life insurance policies, and assume that each $T_i , i = 1,...,30$, follows an exponential distribution with mean 2,
independently of all others.
Calculate, approximately, the probability that the total of all 30 times which elapse until a claim arises on each of the portfolios exceeds 45 days.
\end{enumerate}

\item (i) $T ~ Exp(0.5)$ and therefore $P ( T > 1) = e − 0.5 × 1 = 0.6065$ .
\item (ii) The median, $M$, is such that

which gives
\[1 − e − 0.5 M = 0.5 ⇒ M = − 2 log(0.5) , or M = 2 log(2) = 1.386 .\]

\item (iii)
From CLT, Y = ∑ T i ~ N (30 × 2, 30 × 4), i.e. N (60,120) , approximately.
