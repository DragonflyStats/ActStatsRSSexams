\item Consider two events A and B, such that $P ( A ) = 0.3$ and $P ( A \cap B ) = 0.1$ .
Find the minimum and maximum possible values of the conditional probability
\[P ( A | B ) .\]

\[P ( A | B ) = \frac{P ( A \cap B )}{P ( B )}\]
Maximum value of P(B) is 0.8 in which case P ( A | B ) =
0.1
= 0.125
0.8
Minimum value of $P(B)$ is 0.1, in the case $B \subset A$. Then $P ( A | B ) = 1$
