CT3 A2008—7
\item In a medical experiment concerning 12 patients with a certain type of ear condition,
the following measurements were made for blood flow (y) and auricular pressure (x):

%\sum x = 126.5\sigma x 2 = 1,381.85\sigma y = 113\sigma y 2 = 1, %251\sigma xy = 1, 272.2

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item (i) Construct a scatterplot of blood flow against auricular pressure and comment briefly on any relationship between them.

\item (ii) Calculate the equation of the least-squares fitted regression line of blood flow on auricular pressure.

\item (iii) (a) Use a suitable pivotal quantity with a t distribution to show how to derive the usual 95\% confidence interval for the slope coefficient of the underlying regression line, and calculate the interval.
(b) Use your calculated confidence interval to comment on the hypothesis
that the true underlying slope coefficient is equal to 1.5.

(a) Use a suitable pivotal quantity with a $\chi^2$ distribution to derive a 95\% confidence interval for the underlying error variance $\sigma^2$ , and calculate the interval.
(b) Hence calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the error standard deviation $\sigma$.
\end{enumerate}

95\% CI is $1.676 \pm 2.228(0.3254)$ ⇒ $1.676 \pm 0.725$ ⇒ (0.95, 2.40)
(b)
As 1.5 lies comfortably inside this confidence interval, then there is no evidence at all against the hypothesis that $\beta = 1.5$.
