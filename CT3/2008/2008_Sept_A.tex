The mean of a sample of 30 claim amounts arising from a certain kind of insurance
policy is £5,200. Six of these claim amounts have mean £8,000 while ten others have mean £3,100.
Calculate the mean of the remaining claim amounts in this sample.

Five years ago a financial institution issued a specialised type of investment bond and investors had the option to cash in after 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 years. The following table gives a frequency distribution showing the numbers of those investors who cashed in
at each stage.

Calculate the sample mean and standard deviation of the duration of these bonds before being cashed in.

Let Y be the sum of two independent random variables X 1 and X 2 , that is,
Y  X 1  X 2 .
Show that the moment generating function (mgf) of Y is the product of the
mgfs of X 1 and X 2 .
[2]
(ii)
Let X 1 and X 2 be independent gamma random variables with parameters
(  1 ,  ) and (  2 ,  ) , respectively .
Use mgfs to show that Y  X 1  X 2 is also a gamma random variable and
specify its parameters.

A random sample of 15 observations is taken from a normally distributed population
of values. The sample mean is 94.2 and the sample variance is 24.86.
Calculate a 99% confidence interval for the population mean.
