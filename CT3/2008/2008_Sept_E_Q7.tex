Let N be the number of claims arising on a group of policies in a period of one week and suppose that N follows a Poisson distribution with mean 60.
Let $\{X_1 , X_2 ,  \ldots , X_N \}$ be the corresponding claim amounts and suppose that, independently of N, these are independent and identically distributed with mean £500
and standard deviation £400.
N
Let S   X i be the total claim amount for the period of one week.
i  1
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item (i) Determine the mean and the standard deviation of S.
\item (ii) Explain why the distribution of S can be taken as approximately normal, and hence calculate, approximately, the probability that S is greater than £40,000.
\end{enumerate}

(i)
\[E ( S ) = E ( N ) E ( X ) = (60)(500) = £30, 000\]
\[V ( S ) = E ( N ) V ( X ) + V ( N )[ E ( X )] 2\]
\[= (60)(400 2 ) + (60)(500 2 ) = 24, 600, 000 ∴ sd ( S ) = £4,960\]
(ii)
As S is the sum of a large number of i.i.d. variables, then the central limit theorem gives an approximate normal distribution for S.

[Note: 2.02 leading to 0.0217 is also acceptable.]
