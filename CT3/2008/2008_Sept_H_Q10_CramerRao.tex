When a new claim comes into an office it is screened at a first stage and has a probability  of being cleared for progress, otherwise it is rejected. If it clears the first stage, it is then independently screened at a second stage and has the same probability
 of being cleared for progress, otherwise it is rejected.
\bgin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item (i) Explain clearly why the probability of a claim being rejected at the first stage
is 1 - , of being rejected at the second stage is  (1 - ) and of progressing after the two stages is  2 .
[3]
\item (ii) For a sample of n independent claims which came into the office x 1 were rejected at the first stage, x 2 were rejected at the second stage and x 3
progressed after the two stages (x 1 + x 2 + x 3 = n).
(a)
Write down the likelihood L() for this sample and hence show that the derivative of the log-likelihood is given by
x  2 x 3 x 1  x 2

(b)
Show that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is given by

(a) log L (  ) of the log-likelihood in

part (ii) above and hence show that the Cramer-Rao lower bound
 (1   )
(CRlb) is given by
.
n (1   )
\end{enumerate}
(b) Use the asymptotic distribution for the MLE ̂ with the CRlb
evaluated at ̂ to obtain an approximate large-sample 95% confidence
interval for  expressing it simply in terms of ̂ and n.
[7]
Determine the second derivative
For a sample of 1,000 independent claims, 110 were rejected at the first stage, 96 were rejected at the second stage and 794 progressed after the two stages.
Calculate the MLE ̂ together with an approximate 95\% confidence interval
for .

(i) P(rejected at 1 st ) = 1 – P(cleared at 1 st ) = 1 – \theta
P(rejected at 2 nd ) = P(cleared at 1 st )P(rejected at 2 nd | cleared at 1 st )
