%%- Question 5
\item An insurance company covers claims from four different non-life portfolios, denoted as G 1 , G 2 , G 3 and G 4 . The number of policies included in each portfolio is given
below:
G 1
G 2
G 3
G 4
Portfolio
No. of policies 4,000 7,000 13,000 6,000
It is estimated that the percentages of policies that will result in a claim in the following year in each of the portfolios are 8\%, 5\%, 2\% and 4\% respectively.

Suppose a policy is chosen at random from the group of 30,000 policies comprising the four portfolios after one year and it is found that a claim did arise on this policy during the year. Calculate the probability that the selected policy comes from
portfolio G 3 .
\end{enumerate}

Define the following events:
C: Policy results in a claim;
B i : Policy comes from portfolio i, i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
Then the required probability is P(B 3 |C), and using Bayes’ theorem:
P ( B 3 | C ) =
P ( C | B 3 ) P ( B 3 )
P ( C | B 3 ) P ( B 3 )
,
=
P ( C )
∑ P ( C | B i ) P ( B i )
i
which gives
P ( B 3 | C ) =

1.17 / 30 1.17
[OR It is possible to argue straight to
260/(320 + 350 + 260 + 240) = 260/1170 = 0.222
which is correct and gets full marks.]
