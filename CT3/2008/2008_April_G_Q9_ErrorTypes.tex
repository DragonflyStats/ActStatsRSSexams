\begin{enumerate}

A researcher wishes to investigate whether a coin is balanced or not, that is if P ( heads ) = 0.5 . She throws the coin four times and decides to accept the hypothesis H 0 : P ( heads ) = 0.5 in a test against the alternative H 1 : P ( heads ) \neq 0.5 , if the number
of times that the coin lands “heads” is 1, 2, or 3.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item (i) Calculate the probability of the type I error of this test.

\item (ii) Calculate the probability of the type II error of this test, if the true probability
that the coin lands “heads” is 0.7.

\end{enumerate}

(i)
Probability of type I error is
\alpha = P (reject H 0 H 0 is true) = P ( X = 0 or X = 4 H 0 is true) ,
which gives
\alpha = P { X = 0 P ( Heads ) = 0.5)} + P { X = 4 P ( Heads ) = 0.5)}

(ii)
Probability of type II error of the test at P(Heads) = 0.7 is
\beta = P (accept H 0 H 1 is true) = 1 − P { X = 0 or X = 4 P ( Heads ) = 0.7}
