\noindent It is assumed that claims on a certain type of policy arise as a Poisson process with
claim rate $\lambda$ per year.
For a group of 150 independent policies of this type, the total number of claims during
the last calendar year was recorded as 123.
Determine an approximate 95\% confidence interval for the true underlying annual
claim rate for such a policy.

\noindent \textbf{Solution}

% %--2
\begin{itemize}

\item The mean number of claims per policy is 
\[ \bar{X} = \frac{123}{150} = 0.82 \]

\item Using the normal approximation to the Poisson distribution approximate 95\% confidence interval for $\lambda$ is 
\end{itemize}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bar{X} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\bar{X}}{n}} 
&=& 0.82 \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{{0.82}}{150}} \\
& & \\
&=& 0.82 \pm 1.96(0.0739)\\
& & \\
&=& 0.82 \pm 0.145 \\
& & \\
&=& (0.675, 0.965)\\
\end{eqnarray*}
