\begin{enumerate}Let X be a random variable with probability density function:
⎧ 1 x
⎪ e
f ( x ) = ⎨ 2
⎪ 1 e − x
⎩ 2
(i)
; x ≤ 0
; x > 0
Show that the moment generating function of X is given by:
M X ( t ) = (1 − t 2 ) − 1 ,
for t < 1 .
(ii)
CT3 A2014–2
[3]
Hence find the mean and the variance of X using the moment generating
function in part (i).

%%-- Generally well answered. In part (ii) most candidates were familiar with the method, but some showed poor differentiation skills.
