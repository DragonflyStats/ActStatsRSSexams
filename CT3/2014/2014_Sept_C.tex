7 Consider the following discrete distribution with an unknown parameter p for the
distribution of the number of policies with 0, 1, 2, or more than 2 claims per year in a
portfolio of n independent policies.
number of claims 0 1 2 more than 2
probability 2 p p 0.25 p 1− 3.25 p
We denote by X0 the number of policies with no claims, by X1 the number of policies
with one claim and by X2 the number of policies with two claims per year. The
random variable X = X0 + X1 + X2 is then the number of policies with at most two
claims.
(i) Derive an expression for the maximum likelihood estimator ˆp of parameter p
in terms of X and n. [5]
(ii) Show that the estimator obtained in part (i) is unbiased. [3]
The following frequencies are observed in a portfolio of n = 200 policies during the
year 2012:
  number of claims 0 1 2 more than 2
observed frequency 123 58 13 6
A statistician proposes that the parameter p can be estimated by 􀀄p= 58/200 = 0.29
since p is the probability that a randomly chosen policy leads to one claim per year.
(iii) Estimate the parameter p using the estimator derived in part (i). [1]
(iv) Explain why your answer to part (iii) is different from the proposed estimated
value of 0.29. [2]
An alternative model is proposed where the probability function has the form
number of claims 0 1 2 more than 2
probability p 2 p 0.25 p 1− 3.25 p
(v) Explain how the maximum likelihood estimator suggested in part (i) needs to
be adapted to estimate the parameter p in this new model. [1]
(vi) Suggest a suitable test to use to make a decision about which of the two
models should be used based on empirical data. [1]

The later parts of the question were well answered. However there was a considerable
number of poor answers in parts (i) and (ii). Part (i) particularly, deals with the likelihood
concept which is fundamental in statistics. The setting does not refer explicitly to a usual

that they can work with the likelihood function in a variety of standard models.a
