\item Let X and Y be two continuous random variables.
\item (i)
Prove that $E [ E [ Y | X ]] = E [ Y ]$.

Suppose the number of claims, N, on a policy follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\mu$, and the amount of the i th claim, X i , follows a Gamma distribution with
parameters $\alpha$ and $\lambda$. Let $S$ denote the total value of claims on a policy in a given year.

\item (ii)
Derive the mean of S using the result in part i).

\item Suppose $\mu = 0.15$, $\alpha=100$ and $\lambda =0.1$ 
Calculate the variance of $S$.
