A set of data has mean 62 and standard deviation 6.
Derive a linear transformation for these data that will result in the new data having
mean 50 and standard deviation 12.

We want to find a and b for y = a + bx such that
y  a  bx  50 and s y  b s x
These give b = 2 and a = 50 – 124 = – 74
or, b = – 2 and a = 50 + 124 = 174
Generally well answered.
