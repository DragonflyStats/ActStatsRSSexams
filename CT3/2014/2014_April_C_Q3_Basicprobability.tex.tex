\begin{document}

Sixty per cent of new drivers in a particular country have had additional driving education. During their first year of driving, new drivers who have not had additional
driving education have a probability 0.09 of having an accident, while new drivers who have had additional driving education have a probability 0.05 of having an
accident.
(a) Calculate the probability that a new driver does not have an accident during
their first year of driving.
(b) Calculate the probability that a new driver has had additional driving
education, given that the driver had no accidents in the first year.

%% Question 3
Consider the following events:
\begin{description}
\item[A:] Driver has had additional education
\item[B:] Driver has not had additional education
\item[C:] Driver has not had accident in the first year.
\end{description}
(a)
\[P(C) = P(C|A) Pr(A) + P(C|B) Pr(B) = 0.95*0.6 + 0.91*0.4
= 0.934\]
(b)
P  A  C  
P  C | A  P  A 
P  C 

%Reasonably well answered. Some candidates did not realise that the answer from part (a) could be used in part (b).
