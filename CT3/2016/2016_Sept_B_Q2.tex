\begin{enumerate}

A sample of data has a distribution that has a single mode and is strongly positively
skewed. An analyst computes three measures of location for these data: the mean, the
median and the mode.
(i) State the largest of these three location measures.
(ii) Suggest, with a reason, which would be the best measure of location.



Solutions
Q2
Q2
(i) Mean

(ii) Median â€“ mode could be at the lowest point of the distribution and the mean
could be raised by a long tail.

[Total 3]
Part (i) was answered correctly in most cases. Answers in part (ii) were
mixed, with many candidates failing to justify their answers convincingly.
