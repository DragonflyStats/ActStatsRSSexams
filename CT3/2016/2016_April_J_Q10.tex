%%--- Question 10 

Consider a large portfolio of insurance policies and denote the claim size (in \$) per
claim by X. A random sample of policies with a total of 20 claims is taken from this
portfolio and the claims made for these policies are reported in the following table:
\begin{verbatim}
Claim i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Claim size xi 130 164 170 173 173 175 177 183 183 184
Claim i 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
Claim size xi 185 186 197 202 208 213 215 229 233 272
For these data: xi = 3,852 and 2
xi = 759,348.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item  Calculate the mean, the median and the standard deviation of the claim size per claim in this sample. 
\item Determine a 95% confidence interval for the expected value E[X] based on the above random sample, stating any assumptions you make. 
\item Determine a 95% confidence interval for the standard deviation of X based on the above random sample. 
\item Explain briefly why the confidence interval in part (iii) is not symmetric around the estimated value of the standard deviation. 
An actuary assumes that the number of claims from each policy has a Poisson distribution with an unknown parameter . In a new sample of 50 policies the actuary has observed a total of 80 claims yielding an estimated value of ˆ 1.6 for the
parameter .
\item  Determine a 95\% confidence interval for  using a normal approximation. 
\item  Determine the smallest required sample size n for which a 95\% confidence interval for  has a width of less than 0.5. You should use the same normal approximation as in part (v), and assume that the estimated value of  will not
change. 
Now assume that the true value of λ is 1.6 and the values calculated in part(i) are the
true values. Also assume that all claims in the portfolio are independent and the claim
sizes are independent of the number of claims.
\item  Determine the expected value and the standard deviation of the total amount of
all claims from a portfolio of 5,000 insurance policies. 
\end{enumerate}

Q10 \item (i) Mean: x = 3,852 / 20 =1 92.6 
Median: (184+185)/2 = 184.5

We need to assume that the claim size is normally distributed.

giving n >1.6*(4*1.96)2 = 98.3 
So, n ≥ 99. 
\item (vii) We are now having a compound Poisson distribution for total S.
Expected number of claims from 5,000 policies:
  E(N) = 1.6 * 5,000 = 8,000
\item Expected value of total claim size:
  E(S) = E(N)*E(X) =8,000 * 192.6 = 1,540,800 
V(S) = E(N)V(X) + V(N)[E(X)]2= 1.6 * 5,000 * (30.312 + 192.62)
= 304,107,649

%%[TOTAL 17]
%%Parts \item (i), \item (ii), (iii) and (v) were very well answered. Note that in part \item (ii) the
%%assumptions must be stated for full marks.
%%In part (iv) a common error was not mentioning the asymmetry of the
%%distribution, and part (vi) was tackled with mixed success. Part (vii) was not
%%particularly well answered – many candidates failed to treat this as a
%%compound distribution.
