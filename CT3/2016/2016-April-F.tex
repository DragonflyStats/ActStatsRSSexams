CT3 A2016–7
11 A car magazine published an article exploring the relationship between the mileage
(in units of 1,000 miles) and the selling price (in units of £1,000) of used cars. The
following data were collected on 10 four year old cars of the same make.
Car 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Mileage, x 42 29 51 46 38 59 18 32 22 39
Price, y 5.3 6.1 4.7 4.5 5.5 5.0 6.9 5.7 5.8 5.9
x= 376; x2 = 15,600; y = 55.4; y2 = 311.44; xy = 2,014.5
(i) (a) Determine the correlation coefficient between x and y.
(b) Comment on its value.
[5]
A linear model of the form y = α + βx + ε is fitted to the data , where the error terms
(ε) independently follow a N(0, 2) distribution, with 2 being an unknown
parameter.
(ii) Determine the fitted line of the regression model. [3]
(iii) (a) Determine a 95% confidence interval for β.
The article suggests that there is a “clear relationship” between mileage and
selling price of the car.
(b) Comment on this suggestion based on the confidence interval obtained
in part (iii)(a).
[7]
(iv) Calculate the estimated difference in the selling prices for cars that differ in
mileage by 5,000 miles. [2]

95% CI for ˆβ is given by −0.0469 ±2.306(0.01059) [1]
i.e. −0.0469 ± 0.02442 or (−0.071, −0.022) [1]
(b) Since the value zero is not included in the interval, the suggestion in
the article seems valid. [2]
(iv) βˆ ×5 = −0.2345
Estimated difference in price will be £234.34. [2]

Parts (i), (ii) and (iii) are typical questions on correlation and regression and
were tackled without problems by most candidates. Note that in part (iii)(b)
clear reasoning must be provided for full marks. Performance in part (iv) was
mixed, with some answers suggesting inadequate understanding of the
interpretation of regression coefficients.
