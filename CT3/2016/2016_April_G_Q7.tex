%%-- Question 7 
A random sample is taken from an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda$ . The
sample contains some censored observations for which we only know that the value is
greater than 3. The observed values are given in the following table:
  i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
xi 1.3 1.8 2.1 2.2 2.2 2.4 >3 >3 >3 >3

Estimate the parameter \lambda using the method of maximum likelihood. You are not required to verify that your answer corresponds to the maximum.

%Mixed performance. Most candidates worked through the maximisation steps, but many could not figure out the part of the likelihood corresponding to the censored information.
