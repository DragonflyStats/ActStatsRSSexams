% Question 3 

A random variable Y has probability density function
\[  f(y) &=& \frac{\theta}{y^{\theta + 1}} \qquad y > 1\]

where $\theta >0 $ as a parameter.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Show that the probability density function of $Z = \ln(Y)$ is given by $\theta e^{-\theta z}$ and
determine its range.
\item State the distribution of Z identifying any parameters involved. 
\end{enumerate}

%%-- Question 3 

\begin{itemize}
    \item 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5


$z = \log y$
Therefore $y = e^z$ 

$ { \displaystyle \frac{dy}{dz}
= e^z }$

\[ f(y) = \frac{\theta}{y^{\theta + 1}} \]


\[ f(z) = \theta (e^z)^{-(\theta + 1)}|e^z| = \theta e^{-\theta }  \]


and since $y> 1$ therefore $z> 0$.

\item (ii) This is the probability density function of an exponential distribution with
parameter $\theta$. 
[OR: Obtain using the distribution function:
\[    F_Z(z) = Pr(Z \leq z) = Pr(Y \leq e^z) = F_Y(e^z)\]
  Also, 
  
 \begin{eqnarray*}
F_Y(y) &=& \int^{y}_{1} \frac{\theta}{u^{\theta + 1}} du \\ 
&=& - \left[ u^{-\theta} \right]^{y}_{1}\\
&=& 1 - y^{-\theta}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\item Thus, $F_Z(z) = 1−e^{−\theta z}$ implying an $Exp(\theta)$ distribution.]

\item Part (i) required some work involving probabilistic arguments and was not well
answered. There were no problems with part (ii).
