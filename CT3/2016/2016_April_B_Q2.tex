Consider a random variable U that has a uniform distribution on [0,1] and let F be
the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.
Show that the random variable $X = F − 1 ( U )$ has a standard normal distribution.

For any number x we get
\begin{eqnarray*} P [ X \leq x ] &=& P ⎡ F − 1 ( U ) \leqx ⎤ \\ &=& P ⎡ ⎣ U \leq F ( x ) ⎤ ⎦  \\ &=& F ( x )\\
\end{eqnarray*}

which shows that F is the distribution function of the random variable X , which
proves the result.
%Very poorly answered. Most candidates did not attempt this question and very few completed it correctly.
