\begin{enumerate}
\item 
In order to compare the effectiveness of two new vaccines, A and B, for a childhood disease, 11 infants were immunised with vaccine A and 9 infants were immunised with vaccine B. One month after immunisation the concentration of the disease
antibodies in the blood of each infant was recorded in appropriate units. The sample
mean and variance for each group is given below.
\begin{verbatim}
Vaccine A: n A = 11, x A = 4.05, s 2 A = 0.692
Vaccine B: n B = 9, x B = 4.36, s B 2 = 0.813
\end{verbatim}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
It is assumed that the distributions of the antibody concentration levels after
immunisation with vaccine A and vaccine B are $N ( \mu A , \sigma^2 A )$ and $N ( \mu B , \sigma^2 B )$
respectively. You may assume that the samples are independent.
s 2 A / \sigma^2 A
.
(i) State the distribution of the pivotal quantity
(ii) using the
\sigma^2 B
pivotal quantity in part (i). (You are not required to show the derivation of the
interval.)

s B 2 / \sigma^2 B
Calculate an equal-tailed 95\% confidence interval for the ratio

\sigma^2 A
We now assume that $\sigma^2 A = \sigma^2 B = \sigma^2$. 

Under this assumption, you are given that the
distribution of
18 s^2_p

is χ 18
, where $s^2_p$ is the pooled variance of the two samples and
\sigma
is independent from x A and x B .

The interval is given by ⎜ A B , A B ⎟
⎜ F 10,8,0.025 F 10,8,0.975 ⎟

From tables F 10,8,0.025 = 4.295 and F 10,8,0.975 = 1/ F 8,10,0.025 = 1/ 3.855

As the two samples are independent we have that

\begin{itemize}
\item First compute s^2_p =
10*0.692 + 8*0.813
= 0.74577 ⇒ s p = 0.864
18
\item Then with t 18,0.025 = 2.101 the interval is given by (4.05 – 4.36) \pm 2.101 *
0.864 (1/11 + 1/9) 1/2 i.e. (– 1.126, 0.506).
(v)
\item The interval includes the value 0, suggesting that there is no difference in the
mean effectiveness of the two vaccines.
\item Part (iii) was problematic for many candidates. Many candidates struggled to provide a
‘proof’ that had sufficient rigour.
\item There were errors also in determining the endpoints of the
CI in part (ii), often due to using the wrong percentiles of the F distribution.
