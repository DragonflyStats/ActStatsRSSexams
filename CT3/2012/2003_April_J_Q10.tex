% Question 10
\item In a portfolio of car insurance policies, the number of accident-related claims, N, made by a policyholder in a year has the following distribution:
No. of claims, n
Probability
0
1
2
0.4 0.4 0.2
The number of cars, X, involved in each accident that results in a claim is distributed
as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
No. of cars, x
Probability
1
2
0.7 0.3
\end{verbatim}

\item It can be assumed that the occurrence of a claim and the number of cars involved in the accident are independent. Furthermore, claims made by a policyholder in any year are also independent of each other. Let S be the total number of cars involved in
accidents related to such claims by a policyholder in a year.
(i)
(a)
(b)
Determine the probability function of S.
Hence find $E(S)$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The expectation $E(S)$ can also be calculated using the formula
2
E ( S ) = \sum E ( S | N = n ) Pr ( N = n ) .
n = 0
(ii)
(a)
(b)
Find E ( S | N = n ) for n = 0,1 , 2 .
Hence calculate $E(S)$.

(i)
(a)
S takes values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and we have
P ( S = 0 ) = 0.4
P ( S = 1 ) = 0.4 × 0.7 = 0.28
P ( S = 2 ) = 0.4 × 0.3 + 0.2 × 0.7 2 = 0.218
P ( S = 3 ) = 0.2 × 2 × 0.7 × 0.3 = 0.084
P ( S = 4 ) = 0.2 × 0.3 2 = 0.018
(b)
Hence
E ( S ) = 0.28 + 2 × 0.218 + 3 × 0.084 + 4 × 0.018 = 1.04
(ii)
(a)
E ( S | N = 0 ) = 0,
E ( S | N = 1 ) = E ( X ) = 0.7 + 2 × 0.3 = 1.3
E ( S | N = 2 ) = E ( 2 X ) = 2 × 1.3 = 2.6


(b)
Hence, E ( S ) = 1.3 × 0.4 + 2.6 × 0.2 = 1.04 as before.
Most candidates encountered problems here, as they failed to work out the probability
function from first principles in part (i). Also, many did not recognise this as a
compound distribution type of question.
