Let X be a discrete random variable with the following probability distribution:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
X & 0&1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline
P(X = x)&0.4 & 0.3 & 0.2 & 0.1 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Calculate the variance of $Y$, where $Y = 2X + 10$.

%%--Question 3
\begin{eqnarray*}
E[X] &=& 1\times0.3 + 2\times0.2 + 3\times0.1\\
&=& 1
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
E[X^2] 
&=& (1^2\times0.3) + (2^2\times0.2) + (3^2\times0.1)\\
&=& (1 \times 0.3) + (4 \times 0.2) + (9 \times 0.1) \\
&=& 2
\end{eqnarray*}




\[V[X] = (0 –1) 2 \times0.4 + (1 – 1) 2 \times0.3 + (2 – 1) 2 \times0.2 + (3 – 1) 2 \times0.1\]
= 0.4 + 0.2 + 0.4 = 1
(OR via E[X 2 ] = 2)
V[Y] = 4V[X] = 4
[OR: Directly from the distribution of Y, which is Y = 10, 12, 14, 16 with
probabilities 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1 respectively.]
No particular problems encountered here. There are a variety of different methods for
obtaining the correct answer.
