The random variable S is given as $S = Y_1 + Y_2 + \ldots + Y_N$ (with S = 0 if N = 0) where
the random variables Y i are identically and independently distributed according to a
lognormal distribution with parameters $\mu = 0.5$ and $\sigma^2 = 0.1$. N is also a random
variable which is independent of Y i , and its distribution given below.

Calculate the mean and the variance of the random variable S.

\begin{enumerate}

%% - Question 8
\[E[N] = \sum n P(N = n) = 0.3 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.4 = 1.9\]
\[E[N 2 ] = \sum n^2 P(N = n) = 0.3 + 1.2 + 1.8 + 1.6 = 4.9\]
\[V[N] = E[N 2 ] – (E[N]) 2 = 1.29\]
Also E[Y] = exp( \mu + \sigma^2 / 2 ) = e 0.55 = 1.73325
( )

\begin{eqnarray*}
V [ Y ] &=& ( E [ Y ] ) 2 (exp \sigma^2 − 1 ) \\ &=& 1.73325 2 * (e 0.1 – 1) \\ &=& 0.31595\\
\end{eqnarray*}
Using known results
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5 – September 2012 – %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\[E[S] = E[N] E[Y] = 1.9 * 1.73325 = 3.293\]
\[V[S] = E[N] V[Y] + V[N] (E[Y]) 2 = 0.60031 + 3.87536 = 4.476\]
Some frequent errors were due to mis-interpretation of the mean and variance of the log-
normal distribution.
