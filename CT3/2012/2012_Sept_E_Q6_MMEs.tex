\begin{document}
\begin{enumerate}

A random sample of size n is taken from a gamma distribution with parameters $\alpha = 8$
and $\lambda = 1/\theta$. The sample mean is X and $\theta$ is to be estimated.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item (i) Determine the method of moments estimator (MME) of $\theta$. 
\item (ii) Find the bias of the MME determined in part (i). 
\item (iii) (a) Determine the mean square error of the MME of $\theta$ . (b) Comment on the efficiency of the MME of $\theta$ based on your answer in
part (iii)(a).
\end{enumerate}

    \item (i)
Population mean = 8\theta
\item So MME is solution of $X = 8 \theta$ ⇒

(b) MME gets more efficient (MSE gets smaller) as sample size increases.

%%There was a mix of quality in the answers, especially in parts (ii) and (iii). Attention to detail is required when determining the expected value and variance of functions of sample statistics (here the sample mean).
