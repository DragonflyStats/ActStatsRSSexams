\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Consider a random sample, $\{ X_1 , \ldots, X_n\}$ , from a normal $N(\mu, \sigma^2 )$ distribution, with sample mean $X$ and sample variance $S^2$.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Define carefully what it means to say that $\{ X_1 , \ldots, X_n\}$ is a random sample from a normal distribution.

\item State what is known about the distributions of X and $S^2$ in this case, including the dependencies between the two statistics.

\item
%CT3 A2013–2
Define the t -distribution and explain its relationship with X and $S^2$ .
\end{enumerate}


\newpage
%%---- Question 4
The random variables ${X_1 , ... , X_n}$ are independent
and identically distributed with $X_i \sim N ( \mu , \sigma^2 )$

(ii)
$\bar{X} and $S^2$ are independent
\[X \sim N ( \mu , \sigma^2 / n )\]

\[  \frac{( n − 1 ) S^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2_{n-1} \]

\[t_k = \frac{N (0,1)}{ \chi^2_k / k}\] where $N (0,1)$ and $\chi^2_k$ are independent
This result can be applied here, and we get
\[ \frac{\bar{X} −\mu}{S / n} \sim t_{n − 1} \]

%%Mixed quality in the answers. Some candidates answered part (iii) in the process of answering part (ii) – this did not always show clear understanding, but full marks were given.
