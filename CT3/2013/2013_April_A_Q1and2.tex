The following data represent the number of claims for twenty policyholders made
during a year.
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1

Determine the sample mean, median, mode and standard deviation of these data.

Mean = (7 × 0 + 9 × 1 + 3 × 2 + 3) / 20 = (9 + 6 + 3) / 20 = 18 /20 = 0.9
Median = 1 (observation with rank 10.5)

Well answered. Some working needs to be shown for full marks.

Consider a random variable U that has a uniform distribution on [0,1] and let F be
the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.
Show that the random variable $X = F − 1 ( U )$ has a standard normal distribution.

For any number x we get
P [ X \leqx ] = P ⎡ F − 1 ( U ) \leqx ⎤ = P ⎡ ⎣ U \leqF ( x ) ⎤ ⎦ = F ( x )
⎣
⎦
which shows that F is the distribution function of the random variable X , which
proves the result.
%Very poorly answered. Most candidates did not attempt this question and very few completed it correctly.
