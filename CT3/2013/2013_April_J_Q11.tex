(i)
Calculate an estimate of the probability of having the disease under the assumption that the probability is the same for all age groups.
[1]
Consider the hypothesis that there are no differences in the probability of having the
disease for the different age groups.
(ii)
(a) Construct an 8 × 2 contingency table which includes the expected
frequencies under this hypothesis.
(b) Conduct a χ 2 test to investigate the hypothesis.
[6]
Consider the linear regression model y = α + \betax + ε, where the error terms (ε) are
independent and identically distributed following a N (0, \sigma 2 ) distribution.
(iii)
(a) Draw a scatterplot of y against x and comment on the appropriateness
of the considered model.
(b) Calculate the fitted regression line of y on x.
(c) Calculate a 99% confidence interval for the slope parameter.
(d) Interpret the result obtained in part (ii) with reference to the confidence
interval obtained in part (iii)(c).
