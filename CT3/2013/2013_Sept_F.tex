(i) There is a positive linear relationship between the two.

S xx  =  0.3612  0.101 2 /12  =  0.360
S ff  =  0.1710  0.622 2 /12  =  0.139

(v)
C.I. does not contain zero. Consistent with correlation coefficient not equal to
zero as the test is actually the same. Both suggest that the hedge industry’s
claim that correlation is low may not be correct.
Very well answered in general. This is a typical regression/correlation question and the only
(minor) problems concerned errors with calculators. Note that part (ii)(b) can also be
answered using Fisher’s transformation, which results in the same conclusion.
