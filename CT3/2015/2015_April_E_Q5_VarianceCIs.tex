\noindent A random sample of 30 observations is drawn from a normal distribution with unknown variance.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item (i) Write down an expression for the distribution of S, the population standard deviation. 
The sample standard deviation, $S$, is 7.5.
\item (ii) Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the population standard deviation. 
\end{enumerate}

5 (i)


\[ \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2_{n-1} \]

\begin{itemize}

\item  ${ \displaystyle  \chi^2_{0.025;29 }  \;=\; 45.72}$

\item  ${ \displaystyle  \chi^2_{0.975;29} \;=\; 16.05 }$

\end{itemize}

\begin{eqnarray*} 
\left( \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\chi^2_{0.025;29 }}, \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\chi^2_{0.975;29 }} \right) 
&=& \left( \frac{29 \times (7.5)^2}{45.72}, \frac{29 \times (7.5)^2}{16.05} \right)\\
&=& 35.679,101.64\\
\end{eqnarray*}


95\% C.I. for $S$ is  $( \sqrt{35.679}, \sqrt{101.64} )  =(5.97,10.08)$
Generally well answered.
