11 A property agent carries out a study on the relationship between the age of a building and the maintenance costs, X, per square metre per annum based on a sample of 86 buildings. In the sample denote by xi the annual maintenance costs per square metre
for building i. In a first step the sample is divided into new and old buildings. The
maintenance costs are summarised in the following table:
  sample size n xi  2xi
new buildings 25 100 800
old buildings 61 300 2200
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Perform a test for the null hypothesis that the variance of the maintenance costs of new buildings is equal to the variance of the maintenance costs for old buildings, against the alternative that the variance of the maintenance costs of new buildings is larger. Use a significance level of 5\%. [6]

\item Perform a test of the null hypothesis that the mean of the maintenance costs of new buildings is equal to the mean of the maintenance costs for old buildings, against the alternative of different means. Use a significance level of 5\%. 
\end{enumerate}

To obtain further insight into the relationship between age and maintenance costs for old buildings the agent wishes to carry out a linear regression analysis. Let A denote the age of a building and X denote the annual maintenance costs per square metre.
The agent uses the model E[X ] \;=\; A \beta. The agent has the following summary data
for the age ai and costs xi of the 61 old buildings in the sample.

F\;=\; \;=\; 
Therefore, there is no evidence (at 5\% level) to suggest that the variance for new buildings is larger.
