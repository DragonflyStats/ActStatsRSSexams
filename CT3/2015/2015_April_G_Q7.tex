%% -- question 7 

\noindent A continuous random variable $X$ has the cumulative distribution function $F_X(x)$ given
by:


\[ F_X(x) = \begin{cases}
0, & x <0 \\
\frac{1}{8}x^3 , & 0 \leq x \leq 2\\
1, x > 2 \\
\end{cases}\]

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Determine the probability density function of $X$. 
\item Calculate $P(0.5 <X< 1)$.

Let $Y =  \sqrt{X}$

\item Determine the cumulative distribution function and the probability density
function of $Y$. 
\item Calculate the expected values of $X$ and $Y$. 
\end{enumerate}
