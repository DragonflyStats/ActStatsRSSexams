	\noindent Consider two random variables $X$ and $Y$.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item 
		Write down the mathematical definition for the Pearson correlation coefficient
		$\rho(X, Y)$ between $X$ and $Y$.
		
		\medskip
		Assume now that $Y = aX + b$ where $a < 0$ and $-\infty <  b < \infty$ .
		\item 
		
		Determine the value of the correlation coefficient $\rho(X, Y)$.
	\end{enumerate}

	%%-- Question 2
	
	\noindent \textbf{Part (a)}
	
	\[ \rho ( X , Y ) = \frac{\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) }{ \sqrt{ \operatorname{Var}(X)\operatorname{Var}(Y)}} \]
	\bigskip 
	\noindent \textbf{Part (b)}
	\[\operatorname{Cov}(X, aX + b) = a\operatorname{Var}(X) \]
	\[ \operatorname{Var}(Y) = \operatorname{Var}(aX + b) = a^2 \operatorname{Var}(X) \]
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\noindent For $a < 0$ we obtain $\rho(X, Y)$ 
	
	\begin{eqnarray*} 
		\rho(X, Y) 
		&=& \frac{\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) }{ \sqrt{ \operatorname{Var}(X)\operatorname{Var}(Y)}}\\
		& & \\
		&=& \frac{a\operatorname{Var}(X)  }{ \sqrt{ \operatorname{Var}(X) a^2 \operatorname{Var}(X)}}\\
		& & \\
		&=& \frac{a\operatorname{Var}(X)  }{ \operatorname{Var}(X) \sqrt{  a^2 }}\\
		& & \\
		&=& \frac{a}{\sqrt{  a^2 }}\\
		& & \\
		&=& -1
	\end{eqnarray*}

	% Part (i) was generally well answered. Some candidates gave the sample correlation coefficient, which is not what the question required.
	% Performance in part (ii) was not very competent, with many candidates failing to recognise the negative correlation.
