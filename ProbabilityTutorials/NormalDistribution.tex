\section{Question D05 - Normal Distribution Question 1}
Assume that the number of weekly study hours for students at a certain university is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 22 and a standard deviation of 6.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[i.] Find the probability that a randomly chosen student studies less than 12 hours.
	\item[ii.] Estimate the percentage of students that study more than 37 hours.
\end{itemize}

\section{Question D06 - Normal Distribution } % 10 MarksA model of an onÂ—1ine computer system gives a mean time to retrieve a
record from a direct access storage system device of 200 milliseconds
with a standard deviation of 58 milliseconds. If it can be assumed that
the data are normally distributed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] What proportion of retrieval times will be greater than 75
	milliseconds?
	\item[(ii)] What proportion of retrieval times will be between 150
	milliseconds and 250 milliseconds?
	\item[(iii)] What is the retrieval time below which 10\% of retrieval times
	will be?
\end{itemize}

\section{Question D07 - Normal Distribution } % 10 Marks

A scientific publishing house produces assembly manuals for kit cars. The number
of manuals sold every year is known to be normally distributed with a mean of 500 and a
standard deviation of 50.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[a.](2 marks) What is the probability that the number of manuals sold will exceed 600?
	\item[b.](2 marks) What is the probability that the number of manuals sold will be less than 300?
	\item[c.](2 marks)  What is the probability that the number of manuals sold will be between 450 and 550?
	\item[d.](2 marks)  What is the minimum number of manuals that the company must print such
	that that 90\% of the demand is satisfied?
\end{itemize}

\section{Question D08 - Normal Distribution Question 2}
\emph{Taken from MA4104 Business Statistics Examination paper, Spring 2008 Question 1 part A}\\


A tyre manufacturer claims that under normal driving conditions, the tread life of a certain tyre follows a normal distribution with mean 50,000 miles and standard deviation 5000 miles.

\begin{itemize}
	\item [(i)] If your tyres wear out at 45,000 miles, would you consider this unusual? Support your answer with an appropriate probability calculation using the normal curve. % [ 10 marks ]
	
	\item [(ii)] If the manufacturer sells 100,000 of these tyres and warrants them to last at least 40,000 miles, about how many tyres will wear out before the warranty expires?% [ 10 marks ]
\end{itemize}

\section{Question D09 - Normal Distribution (3 Marks)} % 15 Marks
Suppose $X$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $\mu =500$ and $\sigma = 24$

\begin{itemize}
	\item[a.] (1 Mark) Compute the value of $P(X \geq 518)$
	\item[b.] (1 Mark) Compute the value of $P(X \leq 482)$
	\item[c.] (1 Mark) Compute the value of $P(482 \leq X \leq 518)$
\end{itemize}

\section{Normal Distribution - Short Questions}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item 95\% of students at school weigh between 62 kg and 90 kg.
	Assuming this data is normally distributed, what are the mean and standard deviation?
	
	\item A machine produces electrical components.
	99.7\% of the components have lengths between 1.176 cm and 1.224 cm.
	Assuming this data is normally distributed, what are the mean and standard deviation?
	
	\item 68\% of the marks in a test are between 52 and 64
	Assuming this data is normally distributed, what are the mean and standard deviation?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Question D10 -  Exponential Distribution}



Assume that the length of injected moulded plastic components are normally distributed with a mean of 10mm and a standard deviation of 2mm.  
Draw a rough sketch and then calculate corresponding probability for the following measurements occurring on an individual component:

\begin{itemize} 
	\item[(i)]	Between 10 and 12.4mms
	\item[(ii)]	Less than 9.7 mms
	\item[(iii)]	Between 9.8 and 10.1 mms
	\item[(iv)]	Less than 10.3 mms
\end{itemize}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item The Fresha Tea Company pack tea in bags marked as 250 g
	A large number of packs of tea were weighed and the mean and standard deviation were calculated as 255 g and 2.5 g respectively.
	Assuming this data is normally distributed, what percentage of packs are underweight?
	
	\item Students pass a test if they score 50\% or more.
	
	The marks of a large number of students were sampled and the mean and standard deviation were calculated as 42\% and 8\% respectively.
	
	Assuming this data is normally distributed, what percentage of students pass the test?
	
\end{enumerate}
