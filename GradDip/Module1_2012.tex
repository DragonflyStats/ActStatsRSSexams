Let C be a circle with unit radius so that the length of the side of an inscribed
equilateral triangle is 3 . Three possible ways of describing a "random chord" are
suggested.
(i) Select two points independently and uniformly distributed on the
circumference, and join them.
(ii) Select a point P within the interior of the circle at random (i.e. uniformly
distributed), and join P to the centre of the circle along a radius. The chord is
the line through P perpendicular to this radius.
(iii) First select a radius at random (i.e. uniformly distributed over all directions),
then choose a point Q uniformly distributed along this radius. The chord is the
line through Q perpendicular to this radius.
In each case, find the probability that the length of the "random chord" exceeds
3 .
