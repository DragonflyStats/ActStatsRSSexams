Claim events on a portfolio of insurance policies follow a Poisson process with
parameter l. Individual claim amounts, X, follow a Normal distribution with
parameters m = 500 and s 2 = 200.
The insurance company calculates premiums using a premium loading factor of 20%.

The insurance company actuary believes that claim amounts are better modelled using
an exponential distribution. You may assume that the mean m is unchanged, and is
now equal to the standard deviation.

The Yule walker equations for this process are for ρ 1 :

ρ 2 =

For α = 1 , the process is not stationary but ∇ 3 X t is as it becomes a white
noise.

In this case we need to fit the white noise to the T − 3 third differenced

Many candidates scored well on this relatively straightforward time-

correctly.

r is the unique positive root of the equation:
λ + cr = λ M X ( r )
