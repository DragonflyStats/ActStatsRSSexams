\begin{enumerate}
Claim amounts on a certain type of insurance policy follow a distribution with density
\[f ( x ) = 3 cx 2 e − cx for x > 0\]
3
where c is an unknown positive constant. The insurer has in place individual excess
of loss reinsurance with an excess of 50. The following ten payments are made by the
insurer:
Losses below the retention: 23, 37, 41, 11, 19, 33
Losses above the retention: 50, 50, 50, 50
Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of c.

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
The likelihood function is given by:

L = D \times \product 3 cx i 2 e − cx i \times e − 4 \times 50

c
i = 1
where D is a constant.
Where the x i are the claims below the retention.

l = log L = log D + \sum  log 3 cx i − c \sum  x i 3 − 4 \times 50 3 c

i = 1
i = 1

i = 1 i = 1
= log D + 6 log 3 + 6 log c + \sum  log x i 2 − c \sum  x i 3 − 4 \times 50 3 c
\item Differentiating we get
