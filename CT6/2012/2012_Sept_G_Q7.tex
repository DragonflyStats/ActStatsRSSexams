Individual claim amounts from a particular type of insurance policy follow a normal
distribution with mean 150 and standard deviation 30. Claim numbers on an
individual policy follow a Poisson distribution with parameter 0.25. The insurance
company uses a premium loading of 70% to calculate premiums.
(i)
Calculate the annual premium charged by the insurance company.

The insurance company has an individual excess of loss reinsurance arrangement with
a retention of 200 with a reinsurer who uses a premium loading of 120%.
(ii)
Calculate the probability that an individual claim does not exceed the
retention.

(iii) Calculate the probability for a particular policy that in a given year there are
no claims which exceed the retention.

(iv) Calculate the premium charged by the reinsurer.
(v) Calculate the insurance company’s expected profit.

%% PLEASE TURN OVER

The table below shows claims paid on a portfolio of general insurance policies.
Claims from this portfolio are fully run off after 3 years.

Estimate the outstanding claims using the basic chain ladder approach.
[7]
You are asked to investigate the fit of the model by applying the development factors
from part (i) to the claims paid in development year 0 and then comparing the fitted
claim payments to the actual payments.

(ii) Construct a table showing the difference between the fitted payments and the
actual payments in the table above.

(iii) Comment on the results of the analysis in part (ii).

= 1.548043
85 + 103 + 93
DF 1,2 = 157 + 193

(iii)
Overall the model seems a reasonable fit, though some of the individual
differences are quite large in percentage terms – for example the difference of
5.47 is 18% of the observed value.
Part (i) was well answered, though a small number of candidates continue to throw away
simple marks by not computing the single figure for outstanding claims. This was the first
time in some years that the material in part (ii) has been tested, and a number of candidates
performed the comparison on a cumulative basis rather than the incremental basis that the
question asked for.
