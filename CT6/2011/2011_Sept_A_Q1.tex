\item (i) Explain which strategies, if any, are dominated.
\item (ii) Find the minimax solution to this decision problem.

(i)
We can see that D4 is dominated by D1.
D3 is not dominated since it gives the best results under \theta  1 .
D2 is not dominated since it gives the best results under \theta  3 \theta  ..
D1 is not dominated by D2 since D1 is better under \theta  \theta  2 \theta  .. Similarly D1 is
not dominated by D3 since D1 is better under \theta  \theta  3 \theta  ..
(ii)
The maximum losses are:
D1
D2
D3
30

So the minimax solution is D3.
This was a straightforward question and the majority of candidates scored well.
