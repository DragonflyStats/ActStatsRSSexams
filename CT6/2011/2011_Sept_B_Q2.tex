An accountant is using a psychic octopus to predict the outcome of tosses of a fair
coin. He claims that the octopus has a probability p > 0.5 of successfully predicting
the outcome of any given coin toss. His actuarial colleague is extremely sceptical and
summarises his prior beliefs about p as follows: there is an 80% chance that p = 0.5
and a 20% chance that p is uniformly distributed on the interval [0.5,1]. The octopus
successfully predicts the results of 7 out of 8 coin tosses.
Calculate the posterior probability that p = 0.5.

By Bayes theorem
Pr( p = 0.5 | X = 7) =

%% Many candidates struggled to apply Bayes’ theorem, and many of those that did struggled with the mixed prior distribution. Candidates found this one of the harder questions on the paper.
