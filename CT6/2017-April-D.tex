7 An actuary is assessing three different insurance companies, A, B and C.
Corresponding claim amounts and number of policies are shown in the data below.

2013 1.16 85 0.85 68 1.48 110

Total 4.8 350 3.7 300 6.7 550
Company C has 180 policies to insure in 2017.
(i) Calculate its expected claim amount, using the assumptions underlying
Empirical Bayes Credibility Theory (EBCT) Model 2. [11]
(ii) Discuss why it might be preferable to use EBCT Model 2 rather than EBCT
Model 1 for this purpose. [2]
[Total 13]

8 (i) Write down the general form of a statistical model for a claims run-off
triangle, defining all terms used. [5]
The table below shows the cumulative incurred claim amounts on a portfolio of
insurance policies.
Development Year
Underwriting Year 0 1 2
2014 3,215 6,847 10,078
2015 2,986 7,123
2016 4,167
Claims are assumed to fully run off after Development Year 2. The estimated loss
ratio of both 2015 and 2016 is 91% and the respective premium income in each year
is:
  Premium Income
2014 11,365
2015 12,012
2016 12,867
The total of claim amounts paid to date is 21,186 from policies written in 2014 to
2016.
(ii) Calculate the outstanding claim reserve for this portfolio using the
Bornheutter-Ferguson method. [9]

So the expected premium per policy for company C is
0.7970*0.0122  1 0.7970*0.0127  0.012 3 [1]
So total expected claims in 2016 is 180 * 0.012 3 = $2.21m [½]

(ii) EBCT Model 2 allows for the increasing number of policies that Company C
has seen year on year so is arguably a better estimate. [2]
[Total 13]
Some candidates were clearly unfamiliar with the techniques needed to apply
EBCT II from scratch, although many candidates were able to score well.
Q8 (i) The general form can be expressed as follows:
  Cij  rjsixi j  eij [1]
where
Cij is the cumulative or incremental entry in the run-off triangle; [½]
rj is the development factor for Development Year j; [1]
si represents the exposure (or number of claims / policies); [1]
xi+j is a parameter varying by calendar year; [1]
eij is an error term. [½]
(ii) DF from year 2 to year 3 is 10078 / 6847 = 1.471885 [1]
DF from year 1 to year 2 is (7123 + 6847) / (3215 + 2986) = 2.252862 [1]
For AY 2015, expected ultimate loss is 0.91 * 12012 = 10931 [1]
Expected loss to date is 10931 / 1.471885 = 7,426 [1]
So the adjusted ultimate loss is 10931 – (7426  7123) = 10627 [1]
For AY 2016, expected ultimate loss is 0.91 * 12867 = 11709 [1]
Expected loss to date is 11709 / (1.471885 * 2.252862)= 3531 [1]
So the adjusted ultimate loss is 11709 – (3531  4167) = 12345 [1]
So the reserve is 10078 + 10627 + 12345 – 21186 = 11864 [1]
[Total 14]
Many candidates were unfamiliar with the bookwork required to answer part
(i), although most scored well on part (ii).
