Projected loss: 643 × 13.877 + 796 × 12.612 + 927 × 11.115 = 29265.67
Claims paid to date: 8923 + 9249 + 7278 = 25450
Outstanding Claims are therefore: 3815.7
The calculations are based on rounding the intermediate calculations to the accuracy
shown. Different rounding will give slightly different answers, and is acceptable.
Carrying all the calculations through in full accuracy gives a solution of 3808.0.
