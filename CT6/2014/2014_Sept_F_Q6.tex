s 1 2 =%%--- Question 6
For three years an insurance company has insured buildings in three different towns
against the risk of fire damage. Aggregate claims in the j th year from the i th town are
denoted by X ij for i = 1, 2, 3 and j = 1, 2, 3. The data is given in the table below.

8,550 8,870
8,130
7,730
Calculate the expected claims from each town for the next year using the assumptions
of Empirical Bayes Credibility Theory model 1.

 ( X ij  X 1 ) 2  (8130  8736.67) 2  (9210  8736.67) 2
j  1
+ (8870  8736.67) 2 = 609866.65
Similarly s 2 2 = 673,400
s 3 2 = 912,800
E(s 2 ()) =

so we have

\item{Town 1}: $0.7037 \times  8736.67 + 0.2963  8232.22 = 8587.2$
\item{Town 2}: $0.7037  7510
+ 0.2963  8232.22 = 7724.0$
\item{Town 3}: $0.7037  8450
