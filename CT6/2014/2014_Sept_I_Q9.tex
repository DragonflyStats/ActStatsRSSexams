%%--- Question 9
(i)
List the main steps in the Box-Jenkins approach to fitting an ARIMA time
series to observed data.
\medskip 
Observations x 1 , x 2 , ..., x 200 are made from a stationary time series and the following
summary statistics are calculated:
200 200 200
i = 1 i = 1 i = 2
\sum  x i = 83.7
\sum  ( x i − x ) 2 = 35.4
\sum  ( x i − x )( x i − 1 − x ) = 28.4
200
\sum  ( x i − x )( x i − 2 − x ) = 17.1
i = 3
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 

(ii) Calculate the values of the sample auto-covariances \hat{\gamma} 0 , \hat{\gamma} 1 and \hat{\gamma} 2 .
\item (iii) Calculate the first two values of the partial correlation function \phi ̂ 1 and \phi  ˆ 2 .


The following model is proposed to fit the observed data:
\[X t − \mu  = a 1 (X t−1 − \mu ) + e t\]
where e t is a white noise process with variance \sum  2 .
\item (iv)
Estimate the parameters $\mu$ , a 1 and \sum  2 in the proposed model.

After fitting the model in part (iv) the 200 observed residual values e ˆ t were
calculated. The number of turning points in the residual series was 110.
\item (v)
Carry out a statistical test at the 95\% significance level to test the hypothesis

that e ˆ t is generated from a white noise process.
\end{enumerate}

Firstly ̂ = x =
The Yule-Walker equations for this model give
 0 = a 1  1 +  2
 1 = a 1  0
so we have â 1 =
 ˆ 1
= ̂ 1 = 0.8023
 ˆ 0
and ̂ 2 =  ˆ 0  â 1  ˆ 1 = 0.177  0.8023  0.142 = 0.0631
(v)
The number of turning points T is approximately Normally distributed with
E ( T ) =

so a 95% confidence interval for T is
[132  1.96  5.936, 132 + 1.96  5.936] = [120.4, 143.6]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% – September 2014 – Examiners’ Report
We are testing
H 0 : observed e ˆ t are from a white noise process
H 1 : observed e ˆ t are not from a white noise process
Our observed value T = 110 does not lie within the 95% confidence interval.
Therefore we have evidence to reject the H 0 and conclude that the observed e ˆ t
to not come from a white noise process.
A different model is required.

[Total 18]
Full credit was given for considering p-values or significant values and also to candidates
who applied a continuity correction.
Unusually for a time series question this was well answered by many candidates.
