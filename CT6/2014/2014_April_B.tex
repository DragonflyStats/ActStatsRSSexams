A particular portfolio of insurance policies gives rise to aggregate claims which
follow a Poisson process with parameter \lambda = 25. The distribution of individual claim
amounts is as follows:
Claim
Probability
50
30%
100
50%
200
20%
The insurer initially has a surplus of 240. Premiums are paid annually in advance.
Calculate approximately the smallest premium loading such that the probability of
ruin in the first year is less than 10%.

Claim amounts arising from a certain type of insurance policy are believed to follow a
Lognormal distribution. One thousand claims are observed and the following
summary statistics are prepared:
mean claim amount 230
standard deviation 110
lower quartile
80
upper quartile
510
(i)
Fit a Lognormal distribution to these claims using:
(a)
(b)
the method of moments.
the method of percentiles.

(ii)
CT6 A2014–3
Compare the fitted distributions from part (i).

Mean claim is 50 × 0.3 + 100 × 0.5 + 200 × 0.2
= 15 + 50 + 40
= 105
Also
E(X 2 ) = 50 2 × 0.3 + 100 2 × 0.5 + 200 2 × 0.2
= 13,750
so over 1 year the mean aggregate claim amount is
25 × 105 = 2625
and the variance of aggregate claims is
25 × 13,750 = 586.30 2
Using a Normal approximation we need to find \theta such that
P(N(2625, 586.3 2 ) > 240 + 25 ×105 × (1 + \theta)) = 0.1
i.e.
P(N(2625, 586.3 2 ) > 240 + 2625(1 + \theta)) = 0.1
i.e. 240 + 2625 \theta ⎞
⎛
P ⎜ N (0,1) >
⎟ = 0.1
586.3
⎝
⎠
so 240 + 2625 \theta
= 1.2816
586.3
i.e. \theta =
1.2816 × 586.3 − 240
2625
= 0.1948
This question was well answered with many candidates scoring well.

Let the parameters of the Lognormal distribution be \mu and \sigma.
Then we must solve

e 2 \mu+\sigma ( e \sigma − 1) = 110 2

so e \sigma = 1 +
so \sigma 2 = log 1.22873 = 0.205984
230 2
= 1.22873
so \sigma = 0.45385
Substituting into (A) gives
e

= 230
\mu = log(230) −
0.205984

= 5.3351
(b)
This time we have
e \mu+ 0.6745 \sigma = 510 (A)
e \mu− 0.6745 \sigma = 80 (B)
logA + logB ⇒ 2\mu = log510 + log80
so \mu = 5.30822
and substituting into (A)
5.30822 + 0.6745\sigma = log510
\sigma =

log 510 − 5.30822
= 1.37315

(ii)
Calculating the upper and lower quartiles from the parameter in (i)(a) gives
UQ = e 5.3351+0.6745×0.45385 = 282 cf 510
LQ = e 5.3351−0.6745×0.45385 = 153 cf 80
This is not a good fit, suggesting the underlying claims have greater weight in
the tails than a Lognormal distribution.
Most candidates were able to apply the method of moments in part (i) but many struggled to
apply the method of percentiles. In particular, it was clear that many candidates could not
relate the lognormal distribution back to the underlying normal distribution (this was also a
common issue in Q8). Alternative comments on the data were given credit in part (ii).
