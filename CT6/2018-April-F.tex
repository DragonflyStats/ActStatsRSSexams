Consider the following probability density function:

(iii) Set out an acceptance-rejection algorithm, using h(x), which generates samples
from the half normal distribution f(x).[3]
(iv) Determine the value of l for which the algorithm is the most efficient (i.e. on
average require fewest samples from h(x) to generate samples from f(x)).[3]
(v) Show that the samples from part (iii) can be used to generate samples from the
normal distribution with mean m and variance s 2 .[3]

then set y = x, otherwise go to step 1.
The optimal λ is the one minimizing M ,

Most candidates scored well in parts (i) to (iii), although a number
failed to use the cumulative distribution in part (i).
Only the best prepared candidates were able to score well in parts (iv)
and (v).
