\item %% - Question 5 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Show that the following discrete distribution belongs to the exponential family of distributions.

\item
(ii) Derive expressions for the mean and variance of the distribution, E(y) and Var(y), using your answer to part (i). 
\end{enumerate}

6 Model A is a stationary AR(1) model, which follows the equation:
  yt = μ + αyt−1 + εt
where εt is a standard white noise process.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item (i) State two approaches for estimating the parameters in Model A. [2]
Mary, an actuarial student, wishes to revise Model A such that the error terms εt no
longer follow a Normal distribution.
\item (ii) Explain which of the approaches in part (i) she should now use for parameter estimation. [2]
\item (iii) Propose a method by which Mary will be able to calculate estimates of the parameters α and σ2, with reference to any relevant equations.
Mary, has now constructed Model B. She has done this by multiplying both sides of the equation above by (1 − cB), where B is the backshift operator, so that Model B follows the equation:
  \[yt (1− cB) = (αyt−1 + εt )(1− cB) .\]
\item (iv) Explain why Model A and Model B are identical. [2]
\item (v) Explain for which values of c Model B is stationary. [2]

Most candidates were able to make some progress, but only the better
candidates were able to obtain the precise specification. Most candidates
knew the standard results from the theory for part (ii), but then struggled to
apply it in this particular case.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Q6 (i) The method of moments (or method of least squares) and maximum likelihood
estimation. [2]
(ii) The method of moments (or method of least squares) does not make any
assumptions about the distribution of t . [2]
(iii) The parameter estimates are obtained from Y-W equations for the AR(1)
processes. [1]
Namely, 1   and 2
  0 1 where 1, 0 and 1 are estimated from
the sample quantities. [2]
(iv) Both models above are identical as the observations from one also satisfy the
difference equation of the other. [2]
(v) Answer in (iv) implies that the models are equivalent so the process is
stationary regardless of the value of c. [2]
[Total 11]
Candidates familiar with the theory were able to score well on parts (i) to (iii).
Unfortunately there was a typo in the introduction to part (iv), since the mu was excluded, so marks were awarded generously where there was any evidence this had caused confusion in the answers to parts (iv) and (v).
