\item An actuary is simulating claim sizes, X, for a particular insurance policy. X follows
an exponential distribution with varying parameter λ, where λ can take one of three
possible values.
The table shows the distribution function of this external factor, and its impact on λ.

%%This question was generally well answered, but a disappointing number of candidates used the probability density function, rather than the cumulative density function.

Well prepared candidates were able to score highly here, although many candidates gave
insufficiently detailed answers in part (i), and didn’t give expressions in part (ii) as a function
of the correct variable e.g. leaving b(theta) as a function of mu.
