And the credibility premia for the risks are:
\begin{itemize}
\item For risk 1 : 0 . 978213 × 127 . 9 + ( 1 − 0 . 978213 ) × 122 . 167 = 127 . 8
\item For risk 2 : 0 . 978213 × 88 . 9 + ( 1 − 0 . 978213 ) × 122 . 167 = 89 . 6
\item For risk 3 : 0 . 978213 × 149 . 7 + ( 1 − 0 . 978213 ) × 122 . 167 = 149 . 1
\item 
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(ii)
\begin{itemize}
\item The data show that the variation within risks is relatively low (the S i 2 are low, especially for the 2 nd and 3 rd risks) but there seems to be quite a high variation between the average claims on the risks.
\item With the S i 2 being low, this variation cannot be explained just by variability in the claims, and must be due to variability in the underlying parameter.
\item This means that we can put relatively little weight on the information provided by the data set as a whole, and must put more on the data from the individual risks, leading to a relatively high credibility factor.
\item Most candidates scored well on part (i). Only the better candidates were able to give a clear explanation in part (ii).
\end{itemize}
