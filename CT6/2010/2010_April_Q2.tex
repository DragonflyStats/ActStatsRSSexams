%%% - Question 2
\large

An insurance company is modelling claim numbers on its portfolio of motor insurance
policies using a Poisson distribution, whose mean depends on the age and gender of
the policyholder.
\begin{enumerate}
\item (i) Suggest a link function for fitting a generalised linear model for the mean of
the Poisson distribution.

\item (ii) Specify the corresponding linear predictor used for modelling the age and
gender dependence as:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item age + gender
\item age + gender + age \times gender
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

(i) The link function here is $g ( \mu  ) = \log \mu $ .
(ii) (a) The linear predictor is $\alpha i + \beta x$ where the intercept $\alpha i$ for i = 1, 2
depends on gender.
(b) The linear predictor is \alpha i + \beta i x so that both parameters depend on
gender.
Comment: This straightforward question was generally well answered.
