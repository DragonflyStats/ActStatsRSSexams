The random variable X has an exponential distribution with mean 1000. Individual
claim amounts on a certain type of insurance policy, Y, are such that
and
Y = X
for 0 < X < 2000
P ( Y = 2000 ) = P ( X ≥ 2000 ) .
The insurer applies a deductible of 100 on claims from this type of insurance.
Calculate the mean of the distribution of individual claim amounts paid by the insurer.

A casino operator moving into a country for the first time must apply to the casino
regulator for a licence. There are three types of licence to choose from — slots, dice
and cards — each with different running costs. The casino operator has to pay a fixed
amount annually (£1,300,000) to the regulator, plus a variable annual licence cost.
The variable licence cost and expected revenue per customer for each type of game
are as follows:

The casino operator is uncertain about the number of customers and decides to
prepare a profit forecast based on cautious, best estimate and optimistic numbers of
customers. The figures are 14,000; 20,000 and 23,000 respectively.
(i) Determine the annual profits under each possible combination. [2]
(ii) Determine the minimax solution for optimising the profits. [2]
(iii) Determine the Bayes criterion solution based on the annual profit given the
probability distribution P (cautious) = 0.2, P (best estimate) = 0.7 and
P (optimistic) = 0.1.
