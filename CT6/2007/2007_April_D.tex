We will calculate directly the distribution of S I .
P ( S I = 0) = P ( N = 0) = e − 2 = 0.13534

P ( S I = 3) = 1 − 0.13534 − 0.09022 − 0.21052 = 0.56392
E ( S I ) = 0 × 0.13534 + 1 × 0.09022 + 2 × 0.21052 + 3 × 0.56392
= 2.20303
and hence
E ( S R ) = E ( S − S I ) = E ( S ) − E ( S I ) = 10 − 2.20303 = 1.1303.

(a)
Magnitude of the residuals increases over time, suggesting that the
variance is increasing over time.
More positive than negative residuals suggesting there is drift in the
process.
(b)
If y i ( i = 1, 2, ... , n ) is a sequence of numbers, it has a turning point at
time k if either y k − 1 < y k and y k > y k + 1 , or y k − 1 > y k and y k < y k + 1 .
(c)
Let T represent the number of turning points, and let N=100 be the
number of data points. Then
E ( T ) = 2 / 3( N − 2) = 2 / 3(100 − 2) = 65.333
Var ( T ) = (16 N − 29) / 90 = 17.45556 = 4.178 2
P ( T ≥ 59) ≈ P ( N (65.333, 4.178 2 ) > 59.5)
65.333 − 59.5
) = P ( N (0,1) > − 1.396) = 0.919
= P ( N (0,1) >
4.178
This is a two-sided test so there is approximately a 16% chance of
getting such an extreme number of turning points. This value is not
significant at the 5% level, and so this test gives no significant
evidence to suggest that the residuals are not a white noise process.
Full credit should also be given for calculating a confidence interval and
checking if 59 is in this.

X 100 (1) = 5 + 0.9( X 100 − 5) + 0 + 0.5 e 99 = 5 + 0.9(7 − 5) − 0.5 × 0.7 = 6.45
X 100 (2) = 5 + 0.9( X 100 (1) − 5) + 0.5 e 100 = 5 + 0.9(6.45 − 5) + 0.5 × 1.4 = 7.005
X 100 (3) = 5 + 0.9( X 100 (2) − 5) + 0.5 e 101 = 5 + 0.9(7.005 − 5) = 6.8045

where N has a Poisson distribution with mean 2 and X 1 , X 2 , ... , X N is a sequence of
independent and identically distributed random variables that are also independent of
N. Their distribution is such that P ( X i = 1) = 1/ 3 and P ( X i = 2) = 2 / 3 . An
aggregate reinsurance contract has been arranged such that the amount paid by the
reinsurer is S - 3 (if S > 3) and zero otherwise.
The aggregate claims paid by the direct insurer and the reinsurer are denoted by
S I and S R , respectively.
Calculate E ( S I ) and E ( S R ) .

A modeller has attempted to fit an ARMA(p,q) model to a set of data using the Box-
Jenkins methodology. The plot of residuals based on this proposed fit is shown
below.

Under the assumptions of the model, the residuals should form a white noise
process.
(a) By inspection of the chart, suggest two reasons to suspect that the
residuals do not form a white noise process.
(b) Define what is meant by a turning point.
(c) Perform a significance test on the number of turning points in the data
above. (There are 100 points in the data and 59 turning points.)
[6]
On your suggestion, the original fitted model is discarded, and re-
parameterised to:
X n + 2 = 5 + 0.9( X n + 1 − 5) + e n + 2 + 0.5 e n .
Given the following observations:
X 99 = 2,
e ˆ 99 = − 0.7,
X 100 = 7
e ˆ 100 = 1.4
Use the Box-Jenkins methodology to calculate the forward estimates
X 100 (1), X 100 (2) and X 100 (3) .
