The random variable X has an exponential distribution with mean 1000. Individual
claim amounts on a certain type of insurance policy, Y, are such that
and
Y = X
for 0 < X < 2000
P ( Y = 2000 ) = P ( X ≥ 2000 ) .
The insurer applies a deductible of 100 on claims from this type of insurance.
Calculate the mean of the distribution of individual claim amounts paid by the insurer.
