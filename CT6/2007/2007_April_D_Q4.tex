CT6 A2007—24
A casino operator moving into a country for the first time must apply to the casino
regulator for a licence. There are three types of licence to choose from — slots, dice
and cards — each with different running costs. The casino operator has to pay a fixed
amount annually (£1,300,000) to the regulator, plus a variable annual licence cost.
The variable licence cost and expected revenue per customer for each type of game
are as follows:

The casino operator is uncertain about the number of customers and decides to
prepare a profit forecast based on cautious, best estimate and optimistic numbers of
customers. The figures are 14,000; 20,000 and 23,000 respectively.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item (i) Determine the annual profits under each possible combination. [
\item (ii) Determine the minimax solution for optimising the profits. 
\item (iii) Determine the Bayes criterion solution based on the annual profit given the
probability distribution P (cautious) = 0.2, P (best estimate) = 0.7 and
P (optimistic) = 0.1.
\end{enumerate}
