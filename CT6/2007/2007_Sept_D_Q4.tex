CT6 S2007—24
The table below gives the cumulative incurred claims by year and earned premiums
for a particular type of motor policy (Figures in £000s).
Claims paid to date total £15,000,000. The ultimate loss ratio is expected to be in line
with the 2003 accident year.

Ignoring inflation, use the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method to calculate the total reserve
required to meet the outstanding claims, assuming that the claims are fully developed
by the end of development year 3.
