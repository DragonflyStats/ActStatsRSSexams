Consider the following time series model:

where B is the backshift operator and e t is a standard white noise process with
variance s 2 .

Now assume that X t is stationary.

Claim events on a portfolio of insurance policies follow a Poisson process with
parameter l. Individual claim amounts, X, follow a Normal distribution with
parameters m = 500 and s 2 = 200.
The insurance company calculates premiums using a premium loading factor of 20%.

Show that the adjustment coefficient, r = 0.000708 to three significant figures.

The insurance company’s initial surplus is 5,000.
(ii)
Calculate an upper bound on the probability of ruin, using Lundberg’s
inequality.
The insurance company actuary believes that claim amounts are better modelled using
an exponential distribution. You may assume that the mean m is unchanged, and is
now equal to the standard deviation.
(iii) Calculate the new upper bound of the probability of ruin.
(iv) Give a reason why claim amounts on insurance policies are not usually
modelled using a Normal distribution, and suggest an alternative distribution,
other than the exponential.

Q7
(i) The characteristic polynomial has a triple root of B = 1 / \alpha 
and therefore for \alpha  < 1 ensures stationarity
(ii) Expanding the cubic sum in the initial equation we have
( 1 − 3 \alpha  B + 3 \alpha  B
2 2


)
− \alpha  3 B 3 X t = \varepsilon t
X t − 3 \alpha  X t − 1 + 3 \alpha  2 X t − 2 − \alpha  3 X t − 3 = \varepsilon t

We have an AR(3) process with parameters a 1 = 3 \alpha  , \alpha  2 =− 3 \alpha  2 and a 3 = \alpha  3
.

The Yule walker equations for this process are for \rho 1 :
Page 7 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% – April 2018 – Examiners’ Report
\rho 1 = a 1 + a 2 \rho 1 + a 3 \rho 2
\rho 1 ( 1 − a 2 ) =           
a 1 + a 3 \rho 2
( 1 )

And for \rho 2 :
\rho 2 = a 1 \rho 1 + a 2 + a 3 \rho 1
\rho 2 =
( a 1 + a 3 ) \rho 1 + a 2           ( 2 )

And therefore rearranging (1) and (2)
a 1 + a 3 a 2
3 \alpha  − 3 \alpha  5
=
\rho 1
=
1 − a 2 − a 1 a 3 − a 3 2 1 + 3 \alpha  2 − 3 \alpha  4 − \alpha  6

And
\rho 2 =
(iii)
( a 1 + a 3 ) \rho 1 + a 2 =
(

) 1 + 3 \alpha

Using the definition (Tables have these too)
\rho − \rho 2
φ 1 =\rho 1   
and φ 2 = 2 2 1
1 − \rho 1
(iv)


For \alpha  = 1 , the process is not stationary but ∇ 3 X t is as it becomes a white
noise.

In this case we need to fit the white noise to the T − 3 third differenced
observations ∇ 3 X 1 , ∇ 3 X 2 ... ∇ 3 X T − 3 .

Many candidates scored well on this relatively straightforward time-
series question, although a good number struggled with the algebra in
part (ii) and only the strongest candidates were able to answer part (iv)
correctly.
Q8
(i)
r is the unique positive root of the equation:
λ + cr = λ M X ( r )

c 1.2 λ E ( X ) , so the equation simplifies to
Here =
1 + 1.2 E ( X ) r =
M X ( r )

Page 8 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% – April 2018 – Examiners’ Report
M X ( r ) =
1
\mu r + \sigma 2 r 2
e 2
(from tables)

E ( X ) = 500 (from question)
So 1 + 600 r

= 0

At r = 0.000 7075, LHS is +0.000 03, and at r = 0.000 708 5, LHS is
–0.000 08

So the adjustment coefficient must be 0.000 708 to 3sf
− 0.000 708*5000

1 + 600 r =

r 2 0 
r (0.2 − 600 r ) = 0 ⇒ r = 1

Normal distributions allow the possibility of negative claim amounts 
Normal distributions do not have “fat tails”, commonly observed in insurance
claims

Normal distributions are not positively skewed, unlike typical claim amounts
