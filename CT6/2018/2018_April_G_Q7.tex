Consider the following time series model:
\[(1 – \alpha B) 3 X t = \varepsilon t\]
where B is the backshift operator and e t is a standard white noise process with
variance s 2 .
(i)
Determine for which values of a the process X t is stationary.

Now assume that X t is stationary.
(ii) Calculate the autocorrelation function for the first two lags: r 1 and r 2 , using
the Yule-Walker equations.

(iii) State the formulae, in terms of r 1 and r 2 , for the first two values of the partial
auto correlation function f 1 and f 2 .
Now assume that a = 1.
(iv)


Explain how to fit the parameter of this model, given the time series
observations X 1 , X 2 , ..., X T .

Claim events on a portfolio of insurance policies follow a Poisson process with
parameter l. Individual claim amounts, X, follow a Normal distribution with
parameters m = 500 and s 2 = 200.
The insurance company calculates premiums using a premium loading factor of 20%.
(i)
Show that the adjustment coefficient, r = 0.000708 to three significant figures.

The insurance company’s initial surplus is 5,000.
(ii)
Calculate an upper bound on the probability of ruin, using Lundberg’s
inequality.
The insurance company actuary believes that claim amounts are better modelled using
an exponential distribution. You may assume that the mean m is unchanged, and is
now equal to the standard deviation.
(iii) Calculate the new upper bound of the probability of ruin.
(iv) Give a reason why claim amounts on insurance policies are not usually
modelled using a Normal distribution, and suggest an alternative distribution,
other than the exponential.

Q7
(i) The characteristic polynomial has a triple root of B = 1 / \alpha 
and therefore for \alpha  < 1 ensures stationarity
(ii) Expanding the cubic sum in the initial equation we have
( 1 − 3 \alpha  B + 3 \alpha  B
2 2


)
− \alpha  3 B 3 X t = \varepsilon t
X t − 3 \alpha  X t − 1 + 3 \alpha  2 X t − 2 − \alpha  3 X t − 3 = \varepsilon t

We have an AR(3) process with parameters a 1 = 3 \alpha  , \alpha  2 =− 3 \alpha  2 and a 3 = \alpha  3
.

The Yule walker equations for this process are for \rho 1 :
Page 7 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% – April 2018 – Examiners’ Report
\rho 1 = a 1 + a 2 \rho 1 + a 3 \rho 2
\rho 1 ( 1 − a 2 ) =           
a 1 + a 3 \rho 2
( 1 )

And for \rho 2 :
\rho 2 = a 1 \rho 1 + a 2 + a 3 \rho 1
\rho 2 =
( a 1 + a 3 ) \rho 1 + a 2           ( 2 )

And therefore rearranging (1) and (2)
a 1 + a 3 a 2
3 \alpha  − 3 \alpha  5
=
\rho 1
=
1 − a 2 − a 1 a 3 − a 3 2 1 + 3 \alpha  2 − 3 \alpha  4 − \alpha  6

And
\rho 2 =
(iii)
( a 1 + a 3 ) \rho 1 + a 2 =
(
3 \alpha  + \alpha  3
) 1 + 3 \alpha 
3 \alpha  − 3 \alpha  5

− 3 \alpha  − \alpha

− 3 \alpha  2
Using the definition (Tables have these too)
\rho − \rho 2
φ 1 =\rho 1   
and φ 2 = 2 2 1
1 − \rho 1
(iv)


For \alpha  = 1 , the process is not stationary but ∇ 3 X t is as it becomes a white
noise.

In this case we need to fit the white noise to the T − 3 third differenced
observations ∇ 3 X 1 , ∇ 3 X 2 ... ∇ 3 X T − 3 .

Many candidates scored well on this relatively straightforward time-
series question, although a good number struggled with the algebra in
part (ii) and only the strongest candidates were able to answer part (iv)
correctly.
