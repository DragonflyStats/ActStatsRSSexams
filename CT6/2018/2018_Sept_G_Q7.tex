Claims on a portfolio of insurance policies arise as a Poisson process with parameter
l. Individual claim amounts are taken from a distribution X and we define
m i = E(X i ) for i = 1, 2, .... The insurance company calculates premiums using a
premium loading of q.
\begin{enumerate}
\item (i) Define the adjustment coefficient R.
\item (ii) 2\theta m 1
Show that R can be approximated as
, by truncating the series expansion
m 2
of M X (t).
Now suppose that X follows an exponential distribution with parameter γ.
\item (iii)
Show that R =
\theta γ
.
( 1 + \theta  )
The insurance company uses a premium loading of 12%, and the mean claim amount
is 200.
\item (iv)
Calculate R, commenting on the difference with the approximation to R shown
in part (ii).

The initial surplus is 5,000.
\item (v) Calculate an upper bound for the ultimate probability of ruin.
\item (vi) Suggest two methods by which the insurance company can reduce the
probability of ruin.
\end{enumerate}

Q7
(i)
The adjustment coefficient is the unique positive solution to
\lambda M X (R) − \lambda  − \lambda (1 + \theta ) E(X) R = 0

Cancelling the \lambda  terms we have
(ii)
M X (R) = E(e RX ) = 1 + (1 + \theta ) E(X)R

And truncating the expression we get
E(1 + RX + R 2 X 2 /2) = 1 + (1 + \theta ) E(X)R [1⁄2]
i.e. 1 + Rm 1 + R 2 m 2 /2 = 1 + (1 + \theta ) m 1 R [1⁄2]
i.e. R 2 m 2 = 2\theta m 1 R [1⁄2]
i.e. R =

m 1 is 200, m 2 = Var(X) + [E(X)] 2 = 200 2 + 200 2 = 80000

Approximation is therefore 2 * 12% * 200 / 80,000 = 0.000 6 [1⁄2]
True value is (12% * 1/200) / 1.12 = 0.000 536 [1⁄2]
As expected, the approximation is an upper bound for R.

(v) Use Lundberg, 

(vi) Can reduce by holding higher initial surplus / reinsurance / higher premium
loading etc.

This question was generally well answered, although candidates lost marks when not clearly
showing their steps in parts (ii) & (iii).
