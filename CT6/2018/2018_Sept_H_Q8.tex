%%--- Question 8

For a portfolio of insurance policies, claims X i are independent and follow a gamma
distribution, with parameters $\alpha  = 6$ and $\beta$ , which is unknown.
A random sample of n claims, X 1 ,..., X n is selected, with mean X .
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item(i) Derive an expression for the estimator of $\beta$ using the method of moments. 
\item (ii) Explain what the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of $\beta$  represents. 
\item (iii) Derive an expression for the MLE of $\beta$, commenting on the result.
\item (iv) State the Moment Generating Function (MGF) of X.
\end{enumerate}
Let Y = 2n \beta  X .
(v)


Derive the MGF of Y, and hence its distribution, including statement of
parameters.[5]

The MLE is the estimate that maximises the likelihood of having observed the
sample data.

In this case the MLE and method of moments lead to the same result.
