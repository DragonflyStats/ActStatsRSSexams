An insurance company has a portfolio of insurance policies. Claims arise according to a Poisson process, and claim amounts have a probability distribution with parameter q.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item (i) State one assumption the insurance company is likely to make when modelling
aggregate claim amounts.
\item
(ii) Explain what the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of q represents.
\item
(iii) State an alternative to using the MLE.
\item
(iv) Suggest two complications that may arise for the insurance company when it uses past claims data to determine the MLE of q.
\end{enumerate}

Q2
(i) The occurrence of the claim and the amount of the claim can be modelled
separately, they are independent.
[1]
(ii) The maximum likelihood estimate yields the highest probability of observing
what has been observed,

(iii) Method of moments
Method of percentiles
Bayesian estimation
(iv) Insufficient claims

Large claims not recorded (reinsurance)
Small claims not recorded (policy excess)
Change in nature of policy over time
Complications with modelling future inflation


Candidates with a strong knowledge and understanding of the
bookwork were able to score well here, although many struggled to
articulate their points sufficiently well in parts (i) and (ii); and to give
clearly differentiated examples in part (iv).
