%% - Question 10
Consider the following probability density function:
\[h(x) = \sigma e −\sigma x x > 0\]
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item (i)
Set out an algorithm for sampling from h(x) using the inverse transform
method.
Now also consider the following density function, the “half-normal” distribution:
−x 2
2 2 \sigma 2
f (x) =
e
, x > 0
\sigma \pi 
Let M be the maximum of
f (x)
h(x)
2
\sigma 2 \sigma 2
e 2
\item (ii) Show that M =
\item (iii) Set out an acceptance-rejection algorithm, using h(x), which generates samples
from the half normal distribution f(x).
\item (iv) Determine the value of l for which the algorithm is the most efficient (i.e. on
average require fewest samples from h(x) to generate samples from f(x)).
\item (v) Show that the samples from part (iii) can be used to generate samples from the
normal distribution with mean m and variance s 2 .

\item The rejection algorithm is then:
Sample x from $f ( x )$ as in (i) [Step 1] 
Sample u from U(0,1) [Step 2] 
− x 2

\item If u< e 2 \sigma
(iv)
+\sigma x −

then set y = x, otherwise go to step 1.
The optimal $\sigma$ is the one minimizing M ,


this can be found by taking log M and differentiating

(v)
Y is a sample as in (iii)
Sample U from U ( 0,1 ) 
\[X = \mu + Y , if U > 0.5 \]
\[X = \mu − Y , if U <= 0.5\]

Most candidates scored well in parts (i) to (iii), although a number
failed to use the cumulative distribution in part (i).
Only the best prepared candidates were able to score well in parts (iv)
and (v).
