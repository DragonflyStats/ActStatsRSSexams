%%-Question 4
An insurance company has a portfolio of policies, where claim amounts follow a
Pareto distribution with parameters α = 3 and λ = 100. The insurance company has
entered into an excess of loss reinsurance agreement with a retention of M, such that
90\% of claims are still paid in full by the insurer.
\begin{enumerate}
\item (i) Calculate M.[4]
\item(ii) Calculate the average claim amount paid by the reinsurer, on claims which
involve the reinsurer.
\end{enumerate}
