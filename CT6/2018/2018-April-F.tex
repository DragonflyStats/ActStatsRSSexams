Consider the following probability density function:
h(x) = λe −λx x > 0
(i)
Set out an algorithm for sampling from h(x) using the inverse transform
method.
Now also consider the following density function, the “half-normal” distribution:
−x 2

f (x) =
e
, x > 0
\sigma π
Let M be the maximum of
f (x)
h(x)

(ii) Show that M =
(iii) Set out an acceptance-rejection algorithm, using h(x), which generates samples
from the half normal distribution f(x).
(iv) Determine the value of l for which the algorithm is the most efficient (i.e. on
average require fewest samples from h(x) to generate samples from f(x)).
(v) Show that the samples from part (iii) can be used to generate samples from the
normal distribution with mean m and variance s 2 .

The rejection algorithm is then:
Sample x from f ( x ) as in (i) [Step 1] 
Sample u from U(0,1) [Step 2]

then set y = x, otherwise go to step 1.
The optimal λ is the one minimizing M ,


this can be found by taking log M and differentiating

Sample U from U ( 0,1 ) 
X = \mu + Y , if U > 0.5 
X = \mu − Y , if U <= 0.5

Most candidates scored well in parts (i) to (iii), although a number
failed to use the cumulative distribution in part (i).
Only the best prepared candidates were able to score well in parts (iv)
and (v).
