\begin{enumerate}

An insurance company has collected data on the number of claims arising from
certain risks over the last n years. The number of claims from the i th risk in the j th
year is denoted by X_{ij} for i = 1, 2, ..., N and j = 1, 2, ..., n.
The distribution of X_{ij} depends on an unknown parameter q i . The X_{ij} are independent
identically distributed random variables given q i .
\begin{enumerate}
\item (i) Describe briefly what is meant by each of the following: m(q), s 2 (q), E(s 2 (q)),
var(m(q)), and Z, when using Empirical Bayes Credibility Theory (EBCT)
Model 1.
\item 
(ii) Explain how the value of Z depends on the following factors: n, E(s 2 (q)),
var(m(q)).
\end{enumerate}

Q3
\begin{itemize}
    \item 

(i)
m ( \theta ) is the average claim amount for each risk for a given value of $\theta_i$

s 2 ( \theta ) is the variance of the claim amount for each risk given a value of $\theta_i$
E ( s 2 ( \theta ) ) is the average variability of data values from year to year for a single
risk, I 
var( m ( \theta ) ) is the variability of the average data values for different risks 
\item Z is the credibility factor for the EBCT 1 model / weight placed on the sample
mean

(ii)
(a)
(b)
Z increases as n increases, since we place more weight on the data for
that risk

(
)
\item As E s 2 ( \theta ) increases, Z decreases since the variance of the data
from the individual risk is high and so we place more weight on the
collective data.
[2]
(c)
(
)
\item As var m ( \theta ) increases, Z increases since it implies that the means of
the individual risks are very different, so we place more weight on the
individual risk data compared to the collective.

Most candidates scored well here, although some lost marks through a
combination of only using formulae in part (i) and giving insufficient
explanations in part (ii).
