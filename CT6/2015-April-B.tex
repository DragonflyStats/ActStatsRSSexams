 Excess of loss reinsurance where the reinsurer pays any amount of
a claim above the retention.
 Proportional reinsurance where the reinsurer pays a fixed
proportion of any claim.

This question was the best answered on the paper with most candidates scoring well. Some
candidates were unable to manipulate the Pareto distribution.

(i)
X has an exponential distribution with parameter 1.
Let u be a sample from a U(0,1) distribution.
Then using the inverse transform method we set
u = F(x) = 1  e x
i.e. 1  u = e x
i.e. x = log(1  u)
so the algorithm is
Step 1
Step 2
Generate u from U(0,1).
Set x = log(1  u).

x  0
To find the maximum consider g(x) = 2 xe x  x
then
log g(x) = log2 + logx + x  x 2
d log g ( x )
dx = 1  1  2 x

setting this equal to zero we have

 1  2 x = 0
x
i.e.
1 + x  2x 2 = 0
2x 2  x  1 = 0
(2x + 1)(x 1) = 0
x = 1 or x = 1⁄2
but x > 0 so C = 2 × 1 × e 11 = 2
so now set w(x) =

h ( x )
= xe x  x

Step 1

Generate u from U(0,1) distribution.
Generate x = log(1  u).
Generate v from U(0,1).
If v > w(x) return to step 1 else return x.Subject CT6 (Statistical Methods Core Technical) – April 2015 – Examiners’ Report

so on average 2 simulations are needed to
c
2
return 1 value, so in this case we need 20 simulations. Each simulation
requires 2 pseudo-random numbers so on average we will need 40 pseudo-
random numbers.
We accept a proportion
Most candidates were able to produce good quality answers to part (i), although the majority
struggled with part (ii). Candidates with the confidence to apply the acceptance-rejection
method scored well.
