An insurance company has a portfolio of building insurance policies. The company
classifies buildings into three types and believes that the number of claims on
buildings of each type follows a Poisson distribution with parameters as shown:
Type Parameter
1
2
3 \lambda
2\lambda
5 \lambda
where \lambda is an unknown positive constant.
Actual claim numbers over the last five years have been as follows. Here X ij
represents the number of claims from the ith type in the jth year:

(i)
The likelihood function is given by:

L ∝ ∏ e −\lambda \lambda
x 1, i
i = 1
5
∏ e − 2 \lambda (2 \lambda )
x 2, i
i = 1
5
∏ e − 5 \lambda (5 \lambda )
x 3, i
.
i = 1
Where x j , i is the number of claims on the jth type in the ith year.
The log likelihood is given by:
l = log L = C − 5 \lambda − 10 \lambda − 25 \lambda + (log \lambda ) ∑ x j , i .
i , j
= C − 40 \lambda + 804(log \lambda ) .
Differentiating gives:

= − 40 +

and setting this equal to zero gives:

This is a maximum since:

The mean number of claims for the various types are:
X 1 = 16.4 and X 2 = 40.6 and X 3 = 103.8.
With overall mean X = 53.6.

So we have parameter estimates:
E ( m ( θ ) ) = X = 53.6.

0.976436002 × 40.6 + 0.023563998 × 53.6 = 40.9
0.976436002 × 103.8 + 0.023563998 × 53.6 = 102.6
The corresponding estimates based on our computed \lambdâ are 20.1, 40.2 and
100.5.
The estimates are remarkably similar. The biggest difference is for type 1
buildings, where the maximum likelihood estimate gives a lower weight to the
data from that risk, but the credibility estimate gives greater weight.
(iv)
The main limitation is that the model in (ii) does not take account of the
volume of buildings covered, which will probably vary from year to year.
Again well prepared candidates found this question relatively straightforward. Weaker
candidates were unable to construct the likelihood function in part (i). A disappointing
number of candidates were unable to accurately render the standard formulae in part (ii).
