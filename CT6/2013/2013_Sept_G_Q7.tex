[10]
An insurance company offers dental insurance to the employees of a small firm. The
annual number of claims follows a Poisson process with rate 20. Individual loss
amounts follow an exponential distribution with mean 100. In order to increase the
take-up rate, the insurance company has guaranteed to pay a minimum amount of £50
per qualifying claim. Let S be the total claim amount on the portfolio for a given
year.
\begin{enumerate}
\item (i)
Show that the mean and variance of S are 2,213.06 and 413,918.40
respectively.

\item (ii) (a) Fit a log-normal distribution for S using the method of moments.
(b) Estimate the probability that S is greater than 4,000.

Sarah, the insurance company’s actuary, has instead approximated S by a Normal
distribution.
\item (iii)
CT6 S2013–4
Explain, without performing any further calculations, whether the probability
that she calculates that S exceeds 4,000 will be greater or smaller than the
calculation in part (ii).

Let X i be the amount paid on the i th claim:
Then

E ( X i )  50  f ( y ) dy   yf ( y ) dy

 50  0.01 e  0.01 y dy  I 1

Using the notation given in the question.

So the total claims are:

Now

I 1  50 e  0.5  100  0.01 e  0.01 y dy

 50 e  0.5  100   e  0.01 y 

 50
 50 e  0.5  100 e  0.5  150 e  0.5
So
50
E ( X i )  50   e  0.01 y   150 e  0.5

 0
  50 e  0.5  50  150 e  0.5  50  100 e  0.5  110.653066

 2,500  200  150 e  0.5  20, 695.91979
So finally we have:
E ( S )  20  110.653066  2213.06
Var( S )  20  20695.91979  413918.40.

We need to solve:

and
e 2 

 e  1   413918.40.

Dividing (2) by the square of (1) we have:

e   1 
413918.40
2213.06 2
 0.084514
 2  log(1.084514)  0.081132
and substituting into (1) we have:
  log(2213.06) 
0.081132
 7.6615655.

Finally:
P ( S  4000)  P ( N (7.6615655, 0.081132)  log(4000))

8.29404964  7.6615655 
 P  N (0,1) 
  P ( N (0,1)  2.2205)
0.081132


 0.95  (1  0.98679)  0.05  (1  0.98713)
= 0.01319
(iii)
The probability will be lower.
This is because the log normal distribution has a “fat tail” and hence gives
more weight to extreme outcomes.
Only the best candidates were able to derive the value of the variance in part (i) despite the
formula for integration by parts being given in the question paper. The remaining parts were
well answered.
