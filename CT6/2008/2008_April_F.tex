% Question 10
\item A bicycle wheel manufacturer claims that its products are virtually indestructible in accidents and therefore offers a guarantee to purchasers of pairs of its wheels. There
are 250 bicycles covered, each of which has a probability p of being involved in an accident (independently). Despite the manufacturer’s publicity, if a bicycle is
involved in an accident, there is in fact a probability of 0.1 for each wheel (independently) that the wheel will need to be replaced at a cost of \$100. Let S denote
the total cost of replacement wheels in a year.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Show that the moment generating function of S is given by
⎡ pe 200 t + 18 pe 100 t + 81 p
⎤
M S ( t ) = ⎢
+ 1 − p ⎥

.
\item Show that $E ( S ) = 5, 000 p$ and $Var ( S ) = 550, 000 p − 100, 000 p^2$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Suppose instead that the manufacturer models the cost of replacement wheels as a random variable T based on a portfolio of 500 wheels, each of which (independently) has a probability of 0.1p of requiring replacement.
\item (iii) Derive expressions for E(T) and Var(T) in terms of p.
\item (iv) Suppose p = 0.05.
(a) Calculate the mean and variance of S and T.
(b) Calculate the probabilities that S and T exceed \$500.
(b) Comment on the differences.

\item %%- Question 10
(i)
Let N denote the annual number of accidents. Then $N \sim B (250, p )$ and (from the tables) $M N ( t ) = ( pe t + 1 − p ) 250$
If there is an accident, then the total cost of replacement wheels, X , has the following distribution:
Number of wheels requiring replacement
Cost of replacement X
Probability
0
\$0
0.81
1
\$100
0.18
2
\$200
0.01
And $M X ( t ) = 0.01 e 200 t + 0.18 e 100 t + 0.81$.
So
\begin{eqnarray*}
M S ( t ) &=& M N (log M X ( t ))\\
&=& ( pe log M X ( t ) + 1 − p ) 250\\
&=& ( pM X ( t ) + 1 − p ) 250\\
&=& ( p (0.01 e 200 t + 0.18 e 100 t + 0.81) + 1 − p ) 250\\

\[Var ( S ) = E ( S 2 ) − E ( S ) 2 = 24,900, 000 p 2 + 550, 000 p − (5000 p ) 2 = 550, 000 p − 100, 000 p 2 .\]
Alternatively, we note that
\[E ( N ) = 250 p and Var( N ) = 250 p (1 - p )\]
\[E ( X ) = 0.01 × 200 + 0.18 × 100 = 20\]
\[Var( X ) = 40000 × 0.01 + 10000 × 0.18 – 20 × 20 = 1800\]
and
\[E ( S ) = E ( N ) E ( X ) = 250 p × 20 = 5000 p\]
\[Var( S ) = E ( N ) Var( X ) +Var( N ) × E ( X ) × E ( X )]\
\[Var( S ) = 250 p × 1800 + 250 p (1 - p ) × 20 × 20 \\
= 450,000 p + 100,000 p (1 - p ) = 550,000 p - 100,000 p 2 .\]
(iii)
Let W denote the total number of wheels needing replacement. Then
$W ~ B (500,0.1 p )$ and T = 100 W
Hence
E ( T ) = 100 E ( W ) = 100 × 500 × 0.1 p = 5000 p
and
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{eqnarray*}
Var ( T ) &=& Var (100 W ) \\ 
&=& 100 2 Var ( W ) \\ &=& 100 2 × 500 × 0.1 p × (1 − 0.1 p )\\
&=& 500, 000 p (1 − 0.1 p )\\
\end{eqnarray*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(iv)
(a)
If p = 0.05 then
\[E ( S ) = E ( T ) = 250.\]
\[Var ( S ) = 550 , 000 × 0 . 05 − 100 , 000 × 0 . 05 × 0 . 05 = 27 , 250 = 165 . 08 2\]
\[Var ( T ) = 500 , 000 × 0 . 05 × 0 . 995 = 24 , 875 = 157 . 72 2\]

) = P ( N ( 0 , 1 ) > 1 . 902 )
157 . 72

P ( T > 500 ) ≈ P ( N ( 0 , 1 ) >
= 0 . 02859
(c)
The two distributions have the same mean, but different variances – the variance of S is slightly higher than that of T . This leads to a higher probability for such a loss under S than under the approximation T . Though the probabilities are both small in absolute terms, that for S is
20% higher than that for T . Effectively, fewer accidents are needed
under S to give a high loss, because each accident can lead to two
wheels being replaced, whereas under T only one wheel can be
damaged per accident.
Comment: This was a challenging question with many students scoring well here and
some trying to fudge the answers for (i).
