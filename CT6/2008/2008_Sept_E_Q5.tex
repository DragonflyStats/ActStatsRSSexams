5 The table below shows the cumulative values (in units of £1,000) of incurred claims
on a portfolio of an insurance company:
Development year

9,501
The estimated loss ratio for 2006 and 2007 is 87% and the respective premium
income (also in units of £1,000) is:
2005
2006
2007
Premium income
11,041
11,314
12,549
Given that the total of claims paid to date is £20,103,000, calculate the reserve for this
portfolio using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.

2.151156 2.874157=1.336099\times 2.151156 0.652072 7119.08
The second column (IUL) is obtained as 87% of Premium income values. The
third column reports the development factors
7111/9501 = 1.336099 and (7111 + 6850) / (3541 + 2949) = 2.151156.
The emerging liability column is the product of IUL vales with those of
1 - 1/ f .
The total emerged liability is now 2476.08 + 7119.08 = 9595.16 and the total
reported liability is 9501 + 6850 + 3894 = 20245. Therefore the reserve value
is 9595.16 + 20245 – 20103 = 9737.2 .
