%%- CT6-April 2008 Question 2 

A claim amount distribution is normal with unknown mean $\mu$ and known standard deviation \$50. Based on past experience a suitable prior distribution for $\mu$ is normal with mean \$300 and standard deviation \$20.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Calculate the prior probability that $\mu$, the mean of the claim amount distribution, is less than \$270.

  \item A random sample of 10 current claims has a mean of \$270.
(a) Determine the posterior distribution of $\mu$.
(b) Calculate the posterior probability that $\mu$ is less than \$270 and
comment on your answer.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item (i)
\begin{eqnarray*}
P ( \mu < 270) &=& P ( N (300, 20 2 ) < 270)
270 − 300
)
20\\
&=& P ( N (0,1) < − 1.5)\\
&=& P ( N (0,1) <\\
&=& 1 − 0.93319\\
&=& 0.06681\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\item (ii)
(a)
Using the result from page 28 of the tables, the posterior distribution of $\mu$ is
normal, with mean
10 \times  270 300

\mu * = 50
(

= 153.85 = 12.40 2
\item So the posterior distribution of \mu is N (281.54,12.40 2 ) .
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(b)
The posterior probability required is given by:
270 − 281.54
)
12.4
= P ( N (0,1) < − 0.931)
= 1 − (0.9 \times  0.82381 + 0.1 \times  0.82639)
P ( N (281.54,12.40 2 ) < 270) = P ( N (0,1) <
= 0.1759
\item Comment: The probability that the true mean is less than \$270 has risen, as the sample evidence suggests that the true mean is less than the mean of the prior distribution. Nevertheless, the sample size is relatively small, and the variance of the prior distribution is also small, so that a reasonable weight is still given to the prior information.
\item Comment: Some candidates did not use tables for generating the posterior
parameters in (ii)(a). A few gave the correct interpretation in (ii)(b).
