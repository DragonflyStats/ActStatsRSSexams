For a portfolio of insurance policies, claims X i are independent and follow a gamma
distribution, with parameters α = 6 and β, which is unknown.
A random sample of n claims, X 1 ,..., X n is selected, with mean X .
(i) Derive an expression for the estimator of β using the method of moments. [2]
(ii) Explain what the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of β represents. [2]
(iii) Derive an expression for the MLE of β, commenting on the result.
(iv) State the Moment Generating Function (MGF) of X.[1]
[5]
Let Y = 2n β X .

The MLE is the estimate that maximises the likelihood of having observed the
sample data.

In this case the MLE and method of moments lead to the same result. [1]
