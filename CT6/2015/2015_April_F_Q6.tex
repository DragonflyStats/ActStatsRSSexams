Annual numbers of claims on three different types of insurance policy follow a Poisson distribution with parameter $\mu_i$ for i = 1, 2, 3. Data for the last four years is given in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
& Year 1 & Year 2 &  Year 3 &  Year 4 & Total \\ \hline
Type 1 & 5 & 5 & 0 & 1 & 11 \\ \hline

Type 3 & 5 & 6 & 4 & 5 & 20 \\ \hline

\item (i) Derive the maximum likelihood estimate of \mu 1 and calculate the corresponding estimates of \mu 2 and \mu 3 .
\item (ii) Test the hypothesis that \mu 1 , \mu 2 and \mu 3 are equal using the scaled deviance.

Claims fully developed after DY2.

The proportions of claim numbers relating to each DY remain constant in
different AYs.

Cost of claims settled equals amount actually paid out.

The average cost per claim figures relating to each DY remain constant in
different AYs.

Inflation has been allowed for.

[Max 2]
Most candidates scored very well on this straightforward chain ladder
question.
Q6
(i)
A fixed numbers of risks are assumed within the studied portfolio 
The number of risks does not change over the period of insurance cover 
These risks are independent 
Page 6%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% – September 2017 – Examiners’ Report
Claim amounts from these risks are not (necessarily) identically distributed
random variables

(ii) The number of claims arising is either 0 or 1. 
(iii) e.g. Term assurance (yes), household contents insurance (no) 
(iv) In the individual risk model the number of risks is specified and fixed; and the
number of claims from each risk is restricted. This is not the case for the
collective risk model.

Individual risks are independent in the individual risk model, whilst the individual claims amounts are independent under the collective risk model. 
Claims in collective risk model are identical whereas the claims in each policy
in the individual risk model are not.

[Max 3]
(v)
When claim amounts are in fact identically distributed.

Well prepared candidates were able to score highly on this bookwork
question, but a number of students were unable to demonstrate
sufficient knowledge of the individual risk model.

P 1 = 17 + 23 + 21 + 29 + 35 = 125
P 2 = 42 + 51 + 60 + 55 + 37 = 245
P 3 = 43 + 31 + 62 + 98 + 107 = 341
P = 125 + 245 + 341 = 711
X =

So credibility premium per policy are
Type 2: 0.67956 × 720 + (1  0.67956) × 829.18 = 755.0
Type 3: 0.74694 × 900 + (1  0.74694) × 829.18 = 882.1
so overall expected claims
Type 2: 754.98 × 40 = 30,200
Type 3: 882.08 × 110 = 97,028
Candidates with good knowledge of EBCT Model 2 scored well here, however a
disappointing number of candidates were apparently unfamiliar with this method.

Assuming  =  1 =  2 =  3 we have ̂ =

The difference in scaled deviance is given by
 = 2(log L 1  log L 2  log L 3  log L )
= 2(  4  ˆ 1  11 log  ˆ 1  4  ˆ 2  16 log  ˆ 2  4  ˆ 3  20 log  ˆ 3
 12  ˆ  47 log  ˆ )
[The logarithms of factorials cancel]
= 2(47 + 11 log2.75 + 16 log4 + 20 log5 + 47  47 log3.91667)
= 2.6615
Under H 0 :  1 =  2 =  3 we have that  comes from a  2 distribution with
3  1 = 2 degrees of freedom.
The upper 5\% point of the  22 distribution is 5.991. The observed value is
below this and so there is no evidence to suggest that the underlying parameters are different for each risk.
% Most candidates were able to score well on part (i), although only the better prepared
% candidates were able to complete part (ii).
