10 Claims on a portfolio of insurance policies arrive as a Poisson process with  rate . Individual claims are uniformly distributed between 0 and 50, and the
insurance company uses a premium loading of 12\%.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item (i) Show that the insurance company’s adjustment coefficient is 0.0066 to four
decimal places.

The insurance company has entered into an excess of loss insurance agreement with a retention amount of M and with a reinsurer who uses a premium loading of 15%.
  \item (ii) (a) Determine the mean amount per claim paid by the reinsurer as a
function of M.
(b) Determine the minimum retention level Mmin for the insurance
company, assuming that expected net premium income needs to be greater than expected net claims.
\medskip
The insurance company manages to negotiate a lower reinsurance premium loading.
  \item (iii) Explain what happens to the minimum retention level Mmin, without doing
any further calculations. 
\end{enumerate}

(iii) It decreases Mmin since reinsurance is less of a drag.
Again most candidates were able to score well on part (i), but only stronger candidates were able to apply reinsurance theory to score well on parts (ii)
and (iii).
