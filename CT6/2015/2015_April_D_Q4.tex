%%- Question 4

Let $X$ be a random variable with density $f(x) = e^{x}$ for $x > 0$.



\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item 
(i) Construct an algorithm for generating random samples from X. 
A sequence of simulated observations is required from the density function
$h(x) = 2xe^{-x^2} x > 0.$
\item (ii) Construct a procedure using the Acceptance-Rejection method to obtain the required observations. 
\item (iii) Calculate the expected number of pseudo-random numbers required to generate 10 observations from h using the algorithm in part (ii). 
\end{enumerate}

(i)
\begin{itemize}
\item X has an exponential distribution with parameter 1.
\item Let u be a sample from a $U(0,1)$ distribution.
\item Then using the inverse transform method we set
u = F(x) = 1  e x
i.e. 1  u = e x
i.e. x = log(1  u)
\item so the algorithm is
Step 1
Step 2
Generate u from U(0,1).
Set x = log(1  u).
\end{itemize}

(ii)
We first find C = max
x  0
= max
h ( x )
f ( x )
2 xe  x
x  0
2
e  x
= max 2 xe x  x
2
x  0
To find the maximum consider g(x) = 2 xe x  x
then
log g(x) = log2 + logx + x  x 2
d log g ( x )
dx = 1  1  2 x
x
2
setting this equal to zero we have
1
 1  2 x = 0
x
i.e.
1 + x  2x 2 = 0
2x 2  x  1 = 0
(2x + 1)(x 1) = 0
x = 1 or x = 1⁄2
but x > 0 so C = 2 × 1 × e 11 = 2
so now set w(x) =
2
h ( x )
= xe x  x
2 f ( x )
and our algorithm is
\begin{description}
\item[Step 1] Generate $u$ from $U(0,1)$ distribution.
\item[Step 2] Generate $x = -log(1 - u)$.
\item[Step 3] Generate $v$ from $U(0,1)$.
\item[Step 4] If $v > w(x)$ return to step 1 else return $x$.

so on average 2 simulations are needed to

return 1 value, so in this case we need 20 simulations. Each simulation requires 2 pseudo-random numbers so on average we will need 40 pseudo-random numbers.
We accept a proportion
