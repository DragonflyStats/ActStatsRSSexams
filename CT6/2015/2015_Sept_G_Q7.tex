7 A shipping insurance company has insured ships for six years, and classifies the
ships it insures into three types.
Let:
  Pij be the number of ships insured in the jth year from type i,
Yij be the corresponding number of claims.
The six years of data are summarised as follows:

There are 100 ships of Type 3 to be insured in year seven.
\begin{enumerate}
\item (i) Estimate the number of claims from Type 3 ships in year seven using
empirical Bayes credibility theory (EBCT) Model 2. [6]
The insurance company’s actuary is considering using EBCT Model 1 instead.
\item (ii) Explain an advantage and a disadvantage of using EBCT Model 1 rather
than EBCT Model 2. 
\end{itemize}

so Z3 = 636/(636 + 6.5403645/0.04194341) = 0.803 098
X3,7 = 0.803 098 * 0.370 370 + (1  0.803098) * 0.297 572 = 0.356 036
So Y3,7 = 100 * X3,7 = 35.60

(ii) Disadvantages of Model 1
Does not make use of the risk volumes
Requires more assumptions about the data
Advantages of Model 1
Requires less information (does not take account of risk volumes)
EBCT Model 1 is likely to be computationally more straightforward


%This was one of the best answered questions on the paper, with the majority of candidates able to score most or all of the marks in part (i). Only the
%stronger candidates were able to pick up both marks in part (ii), although again most candidates picked up some marks here.
