(ii) Construct an algorithm which outputs a random variate from f(x) using $h(x)$ and the Acceptance-Rejection method. [4]
(iii) Determine the value of β that makes the algorithm most efficient, by maximising the number of accepted values. [6]

Candidates mostly scored well in part (i), although those unfamiliar with the technique of using logs often struggled. Part (ii) was relatively well answered,
although only the best candidates were able to score well in part (iii).
