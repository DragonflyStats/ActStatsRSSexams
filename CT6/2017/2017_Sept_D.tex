Show that the distribution of X is a member of the Exponential family of

Describe the key difference between excess of loss and proportional
reinsurance.

A random variable X follows an Exponential distribution.
(ii)
Show that $E ( X | X > M ) = E ( X ) + M $.
[3]
An insurance company writes travel insurance policies, with a premium loading factor of 15%. There are two types of claims, and a maximum of one claim per policy.
Type I claims are for a delay. Claim amounts follow a Uniform distribution with a minimum of $500 and a maximum of $1,500.
Type II claims are for a cancellation. Claim amounts are Exponentially distributed with parameter λ = 0.001.
5% of policies result in a claim, 85% of which are Type I and 15% of which are Type II.
(iii)
Calculate the premium charged for each policy.
[2]
The insurer is choosing between two different reinsurance policies:
Policy A: The reinsurer covers 10% of every claim, and uses a premium loading factor of 35%.
Policy B: The reinsurer covers the maximum of {0, claim amount – $1,500}, and uses a premium loading factor of 45%.
(iv)
Determine the reinsurance policy the insurance company should purchase, under:
(a)
(b)
the Bayes criterion.
the minimax criterion.
[3]
The insurance company’s actuary, Tom, believes the minimax criterion is more
relevant in this case.
(v)
CT6 S2017–5
Suggest a reason for Tom’s belief.

(iii) A GLM consists of three components:


[2]
a distribution for the data (Poisson, exponential, gamma, normal or
binomial) [1]
a linear predictor (a function of the covariates that is linear in the
parameters) [1]
Page 7Subject CT6 (Statistical Methods Core Technical) – September 2017 – Examiners’ Report

a link function (that links the mean of the response variable to the linear
predictor).
[1]
Most candidates scored very well on this straightforward GLM
question.

Premium = 5%*  85%*1000  1 5%*1000  *1.15  $57.50
(a)
Expected reinsurance cost per policy for A is
35%*10%*1000*5%  $1.75
[2]
[1⁄2]
For B only need to consider Type II
E  X | X  1500   2500 from part (i)
[1⁄2]
So expected cost per policy for B is
(b)
(v)
45% *15% * e  1.5 * (2500  1500) *5%  $0.75 [1⁄2]
So B is better under the Bayes criterion [1⁄2]
B is clearly better under minimax, since total claims are capped [1]
Unlikely that the assumption of independence holds, since events that lead to
travel cancellations are likely to affect more than one policy holder.
[2]
The reinsurer is a malevolent opponent so minimax is appropriate.

The first part aside, this question proved to be the hardest on the paper,
with only the strongest candidates able to score well, particularly on
parts (iv) and (v).
