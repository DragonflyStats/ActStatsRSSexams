\item %% -- Question 11
Claim amounts on a portfolio of insurance policies follow a Weibull distribution. The median claim amount is £1,000 and 90% of claims are less than £5,000.
Estimate the parameters of the Weibull distribution, using the method of moments. [4]
\item %%--Question 2
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item (i)
Explain why a sequence of pseudo-random numbers are often preferred to truly random numbers for Monte Carlo simulation.
[2]
An actuary is generating pairs of standard Normal variates using the Polar algorithm and pairs of pseudo-random variates from a U(0,1) distribution.
(ii)
\item Determine the pairs of standard Normal variates generated by the following pairs of pseudo-random variates where possible.
(a) 0.062, 0.293
(b) 0.984, 0.794
(c) 0.008, 0.961

\begin{itemize}
\item Most students scored very well on this straightforward question.
\item Unfortunately there was a typographical error in the question which referred to ‘method of moments’ rather than ‘method of percentiles’; although this did not affect many candidates, full credit was given to any reasonable attempt at applying the method of moments.
\end{itemize}
