 2 Claim amounts Xi from a portfolio of insurance policies follow a gamma distribution
with parameters k and \lambda  i. Each \lambda  i also follows a gamma distribution with parameters
\alpha and \beta .
\begin{enumerate}


\item
(i) Show that the mixture distribution of losses is a generalised Pareto, with
parameters \alpha, \beta , k. [4]
Claim amounts are now assumed to be exponentially distributed with parameter \lambda  i.
\item (ii) Show, using your answer to part (i), that the mixture distribution of losses is
now a standard Pareto distribution with parameters \alpha, \beta .
\end{enumerate}

(ii) The Exponential is a special case of the Gamma distribution with k = 1. 
So the mixture distribution is

Candidates who were familiar with the necessary bookwork were able to
score very well here, although a disappointing number were not. Most
candidates spotted the first step in part (ii) – setting k equal to 1.
