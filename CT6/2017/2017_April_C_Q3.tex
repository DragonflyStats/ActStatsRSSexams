3 (i) Explain why claim amounts from general insurance policies are typically
modelled using statistical distributions with heavy tails. 
Claim amounts on a portfolio of insurance policies are assumed to follow a Weibull distribution. A quarter of losses are below 15 and a quarter of losses are above 80.
(ii) Estimate the parameters c, γ of the Weibull distribution that fit this data. 
(iii) Determine whether or not this Weibull distribution has a heavier tail than that
of the exponential distribution with parameter c, by considering your estimate
of γ. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Q3 (i) Insurance claims are often very positively skewed, with large claims often
being several multiples of smaller claims. This suits distributions with heavy
tails. 
(ii) 1 e c15 0.25     so c15  ln 0.75

(iii) Since  is less than 1, the Weibull distribution in this case has a heavier tail
than the exponential.

which is clearly negative and so we have a
maximum.
(ii) The Bayesian estimate is very similar to the mean of the prior distribution, 
which is unsurprising since the average number of realised claims has been in
line with this.

Many candidates were able to score well here, especially on part (i).
