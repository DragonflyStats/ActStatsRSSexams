\item %% -- Question 11
Claim amounts on a portfolio of insurance policies follow a Weibull distribution. The median claim amount is £1,000 and 90\% of claims are less than £5,000.
Estimate the parameters of the Weibull distribution, using the method of moments. 
\item %%--Question 2
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item (i)
Explain why a sequence of pseudo-random numbers are often preferred to truly random numbers for Monte Carlo simulation.
[2]
An actuary is generating pairs of standard Normal variates using the Polar algorithm and pairs of pseudo-random variates from a U(0,1) distribution.
(ii)
\item Determine the pairs of standard Normal variates generated by the following pairs of pseudo-random variates where possible.
(a) 0.062, 0.293
(b) 0.984, 0.794
(c) 0.008, 0.961
\end{enumerate}

Q2
(i)
\begin{itemize}
\item Pseudo random numbers can be reproduced 
\item Only single routine required, rather than lengthy table/hardware 
\item Difficult to generate very large set of truly random numbers
\end{itemize}

v 1  2*0.062  1  .876, v 2  2*0.293  1  .414,
s  v 1 2  v 2 2  0.938772

(b)  2*0.984  1  2   2*0.794  1  2  1 , so no variate [1⁄2]
(c)  2*0.008  1  2   2*0.961  1  2  1 , so no variate [1⁄2]

Many candidates scored well here, although a number failed to make
the adjustment to convert a U(0,1) into a U(-1,1).
