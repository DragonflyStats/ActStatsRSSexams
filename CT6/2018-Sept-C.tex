In a two-player zero sum game, the matrix below shows the value to Player 1. Player
1’s strategies are labelled I to VI, where Player 2’s strategies are labelled A to F.

β 18 22 31
γ 23 22 19
Explain whether or not this new 3 x 3 matrix has any saddle points.

Now consider a randomised strategy for Player 2, denoted X, whereby strategy ‘a’ is
chosen with probability p and strategy ‘c’ is chosen with probability 1 – p, 0 < p < 1.
(iii) Find the range of values for p such that X dominates strategy ‘b’.
(iv) Solve the game and determine the value to Player 1 given that ‘b’ is
dominated.[3]

This question posed few problems for well-prepared candidates.
Q6
(i) For Player 1, Strategy VI dominates strategies IV & V
For Player 2, Strategy C dominates Strategy F ...
... and Strategies D & E with IV & V eliminated
With D, E & F eliminated, Strategy III dominates Strategy II
(ii) There are no saddle points, since the maximum in any column is never equal
to the minimum of any row.
[2]
(iii) ‘b’ is always dominated for α.
[1⁄2]
For β, we require 18p + 31(1 – p) < 22
For γ, we require 23p + 19(1 – p) < 22
So 9/13 < p < 3⁄4

Hence Player 2 should choose a randomised strategy with
18p + 31(1 – p) = 23p + 19(1 – p)
p = 12/17 (i.e. choose strategy a with probability 12/17)
with value 21.8

Performance in this question was mixed, with many candidates dropping marks in part (i) for
insufficient explanation of their answer; and fewer candidates were able to score well in
parts (iii) & (iv).
