Claim amounts on a portfolio of insurance policies follow a Weibull distribution. The
median claim amount is £1,000 and 90% of claims are less than £5,000.
Estimate the parameters of the Weibull distribution, using the method of moments. [4]

(i)
Explain why a sequence of pseudo-random numbers are often preferred to
truly random numbers for Monte Carlo simulation.
[2]
An actuary is generating pairs of standard Normal variates using the Polar algorithm
and pairs of pseudo-random variates from a U(0,1) distribution.
(ii)
Determine the pairs of standard Normal variates generated by the following
pairs of pseudo-random variates where possible.
(a) 0.062, 0.293
(b) 0.984, 0.794
(c) 0.008, 0.961

Most students scored very well on this straightforward question.
Unfortunately there was a typographical error in the question which
referred to ‘method of moments’ rather than ‘method of percentiles’;
although this did not affect many candidates, full credit was given to
any reasonable attempt at applying the method of moments.
Q2
(i)
Pseudo random numbers can be reproduced [1]
Only single routine required, rather than lengthy table/hardware [1]
Difficult to generate very large set of truly random numbers

Many candidates scored well here, although a number failed to make
the adjustment to convert a U(0,1) into a U(-1,1).
