%%% - Question 1

%%- Question 1
Claims occur on a portfolio of insurance policies according to a Poisson process at a
rate . All claims are for a fixed amount d, and premiums are received continuously.
The insurer s initial surplus is U (< d) and the annual premium income is 1.2 d.
Show that the probability that ruin occurs at the first claim is:
1 e
2

Ruin will occur if the time of the first claim t is such that
U + 1.2 dt < d
i.e. if
t <
d U
.
1.2 d
The time until the first claim follows an exponential distribution with parameter . So
the probability of ruin is given by
