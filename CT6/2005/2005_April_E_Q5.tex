An insurer believes that claim amounts, X, on its portfolio of pet insurance policies follow an exponential distribution with mean \$200.
A reinsurance policy is arranged such that the reinsurer pays X R , where

\[
X R =
\begin{cases}
0 & if X \leq \$50 \\
X 50 & if \$50 <X \leq M\\ 
M 50 & if X> M\\
\end{cases}
\]


calculate M such that $E[X_R ] = \$100$.

We know that M is to be chosen so that
