%%% - Question 8


The following time series model is used for the monthly inflation rate (Y t ) in a
particular country:
Y t = 0.4Y t
1
+ 0.2Y t
2
+ Z t + 0.025
where {Z t } is a sequence of uncorrelated identically distributed random variables
whose distributions are normal with mean zero.
(i)
Derive the values of p, d and q, when this model is considered as an
ARIMA(p, d, q) model. 
(ii) Determine whether {Y t } is a stationary process. 
(iii) Assuming an infinite history, calculate the expected value of the rate of
inflation over this. [1]
CT6 S2005

(iv) Calculate the autocorrelation function of {Y t }.

(v) Explain how the equivalent infinite-order moving average representation of
{Y t } may be derived.

No functional dependence on Z t 1 , Z t 2 , etc., so q = 0.
Hence this is an ARIMA(2, 0, 0).
