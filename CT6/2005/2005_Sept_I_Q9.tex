Annual premiums written in 2004 were \$5,250,000.
Future inflation from mid-2004 is estimated to be 2.5% per annum.
The ultimate loss ratio (based on mid-2004 prices) has been estimated at 75%.
Claims are assumed to be fully run-off at the end of development year 3.
Estimate the outstanding claims arising from policies written in 2004 only (taking
explicit account of the inflation statistics in both cases), using:
(i) The chain ladder method.
(ii) The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.
