%%% - Question 4


4
An insurer insures a single building. The probability of a claim on a given day is p
independently from day to day. Premiums of 1 unit are payable on a daily basis at the
start of each day. The claim size is independent of the time of the claim and follows
an exponential distribution with mean 1/ . The insurer has a surplus of U at time
zero.
(i) Derive an expression for the probability that the first claim results in the ruin
of the insurer.
[6]
(ii) If p = 0.01 and = 0.0125 find how large U must be so that the probability
that the first claim causes ruin is less than 1%.

(i)
P(ruin on 1 st claim)=
\sum  P ( First claim at t ) \times  P(this claim causes ruin)
t > 0
=
\sum  q t − 1 \times  p \times  P (this claim > U + t )
t > 0
=
\sum  pq t − 1 \times 
t > 0

We want
0.01 \times  e − 0.0125( U + 1)
1 − 0.99 \times  e − 0.0125
< 0.01
hence
0.009875778 \times  e − 0.0125 U
< 0.01
0.022297977
i.e.
e −0.0125U < 0.02257845
taking logarithms
−0.0125U < −3.79076
so that we require
U > 303.26
