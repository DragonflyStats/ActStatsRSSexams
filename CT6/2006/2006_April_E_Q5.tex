(i) Let n be an integer and suppose that X 1 , X 2 , , X n are independent random
variables each having an exponential distribution with parameter . Show that
Z = X 1 + + X n has a Gamma distribution with parameters n and .

(ii) By using this result, generate a random sample from a Gamma distribution
with mean 30 and variance 300 using the 5 digit pseudo-random numbers.

(i)
April 2006
Each X i has moment generating function M X i ( t ) =
Examiners Report
t
. Hence
n
M Z (t) = M X 1
... X n ( t )
n
= M X i ( t ) =
t
which is the moment generating function of a gamma distribution with parameters n and and hence Z has this distribution.
(ii)
= 30,
2
= 3 and
= 300
= 0.1
The random sample can be generated by producing three independent samples from an Exponential distribution with parameter 0.1 and adding them together.

To do this, we need to solve
F X (x) = 1 - e -0.1x = u
where u is a pseudo-random number from a U(0, 1) distribution.

Solving, we have x =
log(1 u )
0.1
So using our pseudo-random numbers to give the exponential samples we have:
u = 0.63292
u = 0.43937
u = 0.08513
x = 10.022
x = 5.787
x = 0.890
and the sample from the gamma distribution is
10.022 + 5.787 + 0.890 = 16.699.
Comments on question 5: Part (i) was well answered but most candidates failed to generate
the required random sample in part (ii).
