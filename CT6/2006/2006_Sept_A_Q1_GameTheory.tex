%%% - Question 1

Institute of Actuaries1
The loss function under a decision problem is given by:
D1
D2
D3
D4

2 3

(i) State which decision can be discounted immediately and why.
(ii) Explain what is meant by the minimax criterion and determine the minimax
solution in this case.

(i) D2 can be eliminated since it is dominated by D3; that is under all
circumstances the loss from D2 is greater than or equal to that from D3.
(ii) The minimax criterion is to choose D so that the loss, maximised with respect
to theta, is a minimum. The relevant maximum losses are
D1
D3
D4

So we should chose D3.
