1 List the main perils typically insured against under a household buildings policy.
2 A No Claims Discount (NCD) system has 3 levels of discount
Level 0
Level 1
Level 2
[3]
no discount
discount = p
discount = 2p
where $0 < p < 0.5$.
The probability of a policyholder NOT making a claim each year is 0.9.
In the event of a claim, the policyholder moves to, or remains at level 0. Otherwise, the policyholder moves to the next higher level (or remains at level 2).
The premium paid in level 0 is \$1,000.
Derive an expression in terms of p for the average premium paid by a policyholder once the steady state has been reached.

Comments on question 1: This straightforward bookwork question was poorly done with relatively few candidates scoring full marks. Credit was given for any other reasonable suggestion not included on the list above.
