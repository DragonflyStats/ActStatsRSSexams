A general insurance company writes claims, whose amounts have a lognormal
distribution, with mean 300 and standard deviation 400. The insurance company
purchases excess of loss reinsurance with retention 500 per claim.
(ii) Calculate the average expected claim size payable by the insurance
company. [6]
Next year, claim inflation is 10%, but the retention amount remains the same.
(iii) Explain whether the average expected claim size payable by the insurance
company next year would increase by 10%. [2]

(iii) The insurance company’s expected claims would increase by less than 10%,
[½]
since the chances of high claims has increased due to the standard deviation remaining the same, hence the reinsurer will pick up a greater share of the claims.% [1½]
