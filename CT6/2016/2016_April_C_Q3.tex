3 A child playing a game believes that a six sided die is unfair, and that he has a
probability p > 1/6 of predicting the outcome of any given throw. His mother is less
sure, and her prior beliefs about p are as follows:
   a 1/3 chance that p = 2/6 and
 a 2/3 chance that p = 1/6
The child accurately predicts the results of 4 out of 10 dice throws.
Calculate the posterior probability that p = 1/6. [6]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Q3 Let X be the number of correct predictions, so X ~ Bin (10, p) [1]
P(p = 1/6 | X = 4) = P(p = 1/6 and X = 4) / P(X = 4)
= P(X = 4 | p = 1/6) * P(p = 1/6) / P(X = 4) [1]
P(X = 4 | p = 1/6) = 10 ( )4 ( )6
C4 1 / 6 5 / 6 = 0.0542 659 … [1]
P(X = 4 | p = 2/6) = 10 ( )4 ( )6
C4 2 / 6 4 / 6 = 0.227 607 580… [1]
P(X = 4) = P(p = 1/6) * P(X = 4|p = 1/6) + P(p = 2/6) * P(X = 4|p = 2/6)
= 2/3 * 0.054 265 9 … + 1/3 * 0.227 607 58
= 0.112 046 … [1]

So posterior prob = 0.0542659 * (2/3)/0.112046 = 0.323 [1]
[TOTAL 6]
Candidates who were well prepared on Bayes’ Theorem and previous exam
questions on this topic did very well here, although a number of candidates
struggled.
