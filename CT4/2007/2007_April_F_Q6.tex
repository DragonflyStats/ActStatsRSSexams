A three state process with state space {A, B, C} is believed to follow a Markov chain
with the following possible transitions:
A
B
C
An instrument was used to monitor this process, but it was set up incorrectly and only
recorded the state occupied after every two time periods. From these observations the
following two-step transition probabilities have been estimated:
2
P AA
= 0.5625
2
P AB
= 0.125
2
P BA
= 0.475
2
P CC
= 0.4
Calculate the one-step transition matrix consistent with these estimates.

Based on the given transition diagram, the one-step transition matrix must be of the
form:
⎛ a
⎜
⎜ d
⎜ 0
⎝
0
e
h
c ⎞
⎟
f ⎟
i ⎟ ⎠
The two-step transition matrix is given by:
⎛ a
⎜
⎜ d
⎜ 0
⎝
0
e
h
c ⎞ ⎛ a
⎟ ⎜
f ⎟ * ⎜ d
i ⎟ ⎠ ⎜ ⎝ 0
0
e
h
2
ch
c ( a + i ) ⎞
c ⎞ ⎜ ⎛ a
⎟
⎟
f ⎟ = ⎜ d ( a + e ) e 2 + fh cd + ef + fi ⎟
⎜
⎟
i ⎟ ⎠ ⎜ dh
h ( e + i )
fh + i 2 ⎟
⎝
⎠
2
P AA
= 0.5625 ⇒ a 2 = 0.5625 ⇒ a = 0.75
Rows of transition matrix must sum to 1.
So,
and
a + c = 1
c = 0.25
2
P AB
= 0.125 ⇒ ch = 0.125 ⇒ h = 0.5
so
h + i = 1
i=0.5
2
P CC
= 0.4 ⇒ f × 0.5 + 0.5 2 = 0.4 ⇒ f = 0.3
2
P BA
= 0.475 ⇒ d (0.75 + e ) = 0.475
Rows sum to 1 so, d + e =0.7
Substitute for e:
d (1.45 − d ) = 0.475 ⇒ d 2 − 1.45 d + 0.475 = 0
Solving using standard quadratic formula:
d =
1.45 ± 1.45 2 − 4 × 0.475 1.45 ± 0.45
=
= 0.95 or 0.5
2
2
0.95 is not possible because e would need to be negative
So
d = 0.5 and e = 0.2
