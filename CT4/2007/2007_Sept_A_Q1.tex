the objectives of the modelling exercise,
the validity of the model for the purpose to which it is to be put,

the possible errors associated with the model or parameters used not being a
perfect fit,
representation of the real world situation being modelled,
the impact of correlations between the random variables that drive the model,
the extent of correlations between the various results produced from the model,
the current relevance of models written and used in the past,
