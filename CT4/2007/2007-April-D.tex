A medical study was carried out between 1 January 2001 and 1 January 2006, to
assess the survival rates of cancer patients. The patients all underwent surgery during
2001 and then attended 3-monthly check-ups throughout the study.
The following data were collected:
For those patients who died during the study exact dates of death were recorded as
follows:

An insurance company is concerned that the ratio between the mortality of its female
and male pensioners is unlike the corresponding ratio among insured pensioners in
general. It conducts an investigation and estimates the mortality of male and female
f
ˆ x+
ˆ m
pensioners, μ ˆ m
x+ 1/ 2 and μ
x+ 1/ 2 to calculate what the expected
1/ 2 . It then uses the μ
mortality of its female pensioners would be if the ratio between male and female
mortality rates reflected the corresponding ratio in the PMA92 and PFA92 tables,
S x + 1/ 2 , using the formula
 x f + 1/ 2 = μ ˆ m
μ
x + 1/ 2 S x + 1/ 2 .
The table below shows, for a range of ages, the numbers of female deaths actually
observed in the investigation and the number which would be expected from the

those of insured pensioners in general. Clearly state your conclusion.

(i)
(a) Type I censoring is present for those lives still under observation at 31
December 2005 as the censoring times are known in advance.
(b) Interval censoring would be present if we only knew death occurred
between check-ups. However, actual dates of death are known, so
interval censoring is not present.
Right censoring can be seen as a special case of interval censoring (for
those censored before death, we know death occurs in the interval (c i ,
∞ ) where c i is the censoring time for person i).
(c)
Page 10
Informative censoring is not likely to be present. The censoring of
lives gives us no information about future lifetimes.Subject CT4 — Models Core Technical — April 2007 — Examiners’ Report

acceptable and received credit.

x
The critical value of the χ 8 2 distribution at the 5% level of statistical
significance is 15.51.
Since 11.3343 < 15.51, we have no reason to reject the null hypothesis that the
sex ratios of death rates among the company’s pensioners are the same as
those prevailing in the PMA92 and PFA92 tables.
Page 12Subject CT4 — Models Core Technical — April 2007 — Examiners’ Report
(ii)
Standardised deviations test
Using the individual standardised deviations test, we note that none of the z x s
exceeds 1.96 in absolute value, so there is no evidence that the sex ratios
among the company’s pensioners are unusual at any specific ages
Signs test
Under the null hypothesis of no difference between the company’s pensioners
and insured pensioners in general, the number of positive signs should have a
Binomial (8, 0.5) distribution.
There are 2 negative and 6 positive signs.
The probability of obtaining 6 positive signs if the null hypothesis is true is
⎛ 8 ⎞ 8
⎜ ⎟ 0.5 = 0.1094
⎝ 6 ⎠
Since this is greater than 0.025 (two-tailed test), the sex ratios of death rates
among the company’s pensioners are not systematically higher or lower than
those derived from the PMA92 and PFA92 tables.
Cumulative deviations test
The cumulative deviation
∑ ( E x c μ ˆ x f + 1/ 2 − E x c μ  x f + 1/ 2 ) ~ Normal (0, E x c μ  x f + 1/ 2 ) ,
x
so that under the null hypothesis
∑ ( E x c μ ˆ x f + 1/ 2 − E x c μ  x f + 1/ 2 )
x
∑ E x c μ  x f + 1/ 2
~ Normal (0,1).
x
Using the figures in the table above we have
∑ ( E x c μ ˆ x f + 1/ 2 − E x c μ  x f + 1/ 2 )
x
∑ E x c μ  x f + 1/ 2
=
14.9
= 0.875
290
x
and since |0.875| < 1.96 using a two-tailed test, the sex ratios of death rates
among the company’s pensioners are not systematically higher or lower than
those derived from the PMA92 and PFA92 tables.

Credit was only given for one of the Signs test and the Cumulative Deviations
test as they both test for bias.

The correlation coefficient is therefore
r 1 =
4.8231
= 0.4503
(10.6863)(10.7310)
We test r 1 8 = 1.27 against the Normal (0,1) distribution using a one-tailed
test.
Page 14Subject CT4 — Models Core Technical — April 2007 — Examiners’ Report
Since 1.27 < 1.645, we conclude that there is no evidence that the sex ratios of
death rates among the company’s pensioners vary with age in a way different
from the ratios derived from PMA92 and PFA92.
Note that the Grouping of Signs test is not appropriate with 8 ages, 6 positive
and 2 negative signs.
