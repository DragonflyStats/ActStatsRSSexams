Suppose that a random variable X has a standard normal distribution, and the
conditional distribution of a Poisson random variable Y, given the value of
X = x, has expectation g(x) = x 2 + 1.
Determine E[Y] and Var[Y].

E [ E ( Y | X )] = ∫ E [ Y | X = x ] f ( x ) dx
= ∫ ∫ yf ( y | x ) dy f ( x ) dx
= ∫ ∫ y f ( y | x ) f ( x ) dydx
but f ( y | x ) f ( x ) = f ( x , y ), the joint pdf of X and Y , so
E [ E ( Y | X )] = ∫ ∫ y f ( x , y ) dxdy = E [ Y ]
(ii)
E [ Y ] = E [ E ( Y | X )] = E [ X 2 + 1]
= V [ X ] + { E [ X ]} 2 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2
Var [ Y ] = Var [ E ( Y | X )] + E [ Var ( Y | X )] = Var [ X 2 + 1] + E [ X 2 + 1]
= Var [ X 2 ] + E [ X 2 ] + 1
but Z = X 2 is χ 1 2 so has variance 2 and expectation 1
Thus Var [ Y ] = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
