A No-Claims Discount system operated by a motor insurer has the following four
levels:
Level 1:
Level 2:
Level 3:
Level 4:
0% discount
25% discount
40% discount
60% discount
The rules for moving betweeN_these levels are as follows:
• Following a year with no claims, move to the next higher level, or remain at
level 4.
• Following a year with one claim, move to the next lower level, or remain at
level 1.
• Following a year with two or more claims, move dowN_two levels, or move to
level 1 (from level 2) or remain at level 1.
For a given policyholder in a given year the probability of no claims is 0.85 and the
probability of making one claim is 0.12.
\item (i) Write dowN_the transition matrix of this No-Claims Discount process.
\item (ii) Calculate the probability that a policyholder who is currently at level 2 will be
at level 2 after:

(b)
\item (iii)

one year.

A company pension scheme, with a compulsory scheme retirement age of 65, is
modelled using a multiple state model with the following categories:
1
2
3
4
5 currently employed by the company
no longer employed by the company, but not yet receiving a pension
pension in payment, pension commenced early due to ill health retirement
pension in payment, pension commenced at scheme retirement age
dead

\begin{enumerate}
\item (i) Describe the nature of the state space and time space for this process.
\item (ii) Draw and label a transition diagram indicating appropriate transitions between
the states.
\end{enumerate}



For i,j in {1,2,3,4,5}, let:
t
p 1i x
the probability that a life is in state i at age x+t, giveN_they are in state 1 at age
x
\mu ijx + t the transition intensity from state i to state j at age x+t
\item (iii) Write down equations which could be used to determine the evolution of t p 1i x
(for each i) appropriate for:
(a)
(b)
(c)
x + t < 65.
x + t = 65.
x + t > 65.

hence the required probabilitY_is 0.2295.
\item (iii)
In matrix form, the equation we need to solve is $\pi P = \pi$,
where \pi is the vector of equilibrium probabilities.
This reads
0.15 \pi_1 + 0.15 \pi_2 + 0.03 \pi_3
0.85 \pi_1 +
+ 0.85 \pi_2
= \pi_1
+ 0.12 \pi_3 + 0.03 \pi_4 = \pi_2
+ 0.12 \pi_4 = \pi_3
0.85 \pi_3 + 0.85 \pi_4 = \pi_4
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
Discard the first of these equations and use also the fact that
\[\sum_{i= 1} \pi_i = 1 .\]
4
Then, we obtain first from (4) that 0.85 \pi_3 = 0.15 \pi_4
or, that \pi_4 = 17 \pi_3 / 3
Page 9 — Models Core Technical — September 2008 — Examiners’ 

Substituting in (3) this gives
0.85 \pi_2 + 0.12 ×
17
\pi_3 = \pi_3 ⇒ \pi_3 = 2.65625 \pi_2
3
(2) now yields that
0.85 \pi_1 = \pi_2 − 0.12 \pi_3 − 0.03 \pi_4 =
1
\pi_3 − 0.12 \pi_3 − 0.17 \pi_3 = 0.0865 \pi_3 ,
2.65625
so that finally we get \pi_1 = 0.10173 \pi_3 .
Using now that the probabilities must add up to one, we obtain
\pi_1 + \pi_2 + \pi_3 + \pi_4 = (0.10173 + 0.3765 + 1 + 5.666) \pi_3 = 1,
or that \pi_3 = 0.13996.
Solving back for the other variables we get that
\pi_1 = 0.01424, \pi_2 = 0.05269, \pi_4 = 0.79311
The long-run probability that the motorist is in discount level 2 is therefore
0.05269.

\item (i)
The state space is discrete with states as given iN_the question.
The process operates in continuous time.
However, at the compulsory scheme retirement
age of 65 there is a discrete step change.
This is sometimes described as a mixed process.
