\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item In the context of mortality investigations describe the principle of
correspondence and give an example of a situation in which it may be hard to
adhere to this principle.
\\ \medskip 
On 1 January 2005 a country introduced a comprehensive system of death
registration, which classified deaths by age last birthday on the date of death.
The government of the country wishes to obtain estimates of the force of mortality,
\mu x , by single years of age x for the period between 1 January 2005 and 1 January
2008. Annual population censuses have been taken on 30 June each year since 2004,
which classify the population by age last birthday. However the only copy of the data
from the population census of 30 June 2006 was lost when the computer disc on
which it was stored was being transferred between government departments.

Let the population aged x last birthday on 30 June in year t be denoted by the symbol
P x , t , and the number of deaths during the period of investigation of persons aged x be
denoted by the symbol d x .
\item (ii)
Derive an expression in terms of P x , t and d x which may be used to estimate
\mu x .

\begin{itemize}
\item (i) The principle of correspondence states that a life alive at time t should be
included in the exposure at age x at time t if and only if, were that life to die
immediately, he or she would be counted in the deaths data at age x. Problems
in adhering to this can arise when the deaths data and the exposed-to-risk data
come from two different sources. These may classify lives differently.
\item (ii) Since deaths are classified by age last birthday at date of death, a central
exposed to risk which corresponds to the deaths data is given by
t  3
E x c

 P x , t
t  0
where P x , t is the population aged x last birthday at time t, and t is measured in
years since 1 January 2005. We have censuses on 30 June 2004, 30 June 2005,
30 June 2007 and 30 June 2008.
\item Assuming that the population varies linearly across the period between each
successive census for which we have data the population aged x last birthday
on 1 January 2005 is equal to
1 ( P
 P x ,30 / 6 / 2005 )
2 x ,30 / 6 / 2004
and the population aged x last birthday on 1 January 2008 is equal to
1 ( P
 P x ,30 / 6 / 2008 ) .
2 x ,30 / 6 / 2007
\item Dividing the period of the investigation into three sub-periods
from 1 January 2005 to 30 June 2005
from 30 June 2005 to 30 June 2007
from 30 June 2007 to 1 January 2008
and applying the trapezium rule to each sub-period produces the following
exposed to risk for persons aged x last birthday
\item For the sub-period between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2005

\item Summing these gives
E x c  1 P x ,30/6/2004  1 P x ,30/6/2005  1 P x ,30/6/2005  P x ,30/6/2005

which simplifies to
E x c  1 P x ,30/6/2004  11 P x ,30/6/2005  11 P x ,30/6/2007  1 P x ,30/6/2008 .

The force of mortality may be estimated using the formula
 x 
d x
E x c
,
where d x denotes deaths to persons aged x last birthday when they died.
\item This was very poorly answered. It was perhaps rather more difficult than some
exposed-to-risk questions in previous examination papers, but nevertheless the
standard of most attempts was disappointing. In part \item (ii) credit was given for various
alternative approximations provided that they were explained clearly.
