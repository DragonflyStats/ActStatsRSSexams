A Cox proportional hazards model was estimated to assess the effect on survival of a
person s sex and his or her self-esteem (measured on a three-point scale as low ,
medium or high ). The baseline category was males with low self-esteem.
Write down the equation of the model, using algebraic symbols to represent variables
and parameters and defining all the symbols that you use.

(a) Explain why it is important to sub-divide data when carrying out
mortality investigations.

(i) Assume that the force of mortality between consecutive integer ages, y and
y + 1, is constant and takes the value Î¼ y .
Let T x be the future lifetime after age x ( x

An investigation was carried out into the mortality of male life office
policyholders. Each life was observed from his 50th birthday until the first of
three possible events occurred: his 55th birthday, his death, or the lapsing of
his policy. For those policyholders who died or allowed their policies to lapse,
the exact age at exit was recorded.
Using the result from part (i) or otherwise, describe how the data arising from
this investigation could be used to estimate:
(a) 50
(b) 5 q 50

F is a variable taking the value 1 if the life is female, and 0 otherwise,

parameters to be estimated.
The models of mortality we use assume that we can observe a group of
lives with the same mortality characteristics. This is not possible in
practice.
However, data can be sub-divided according to certain characteristics
that we know to have a significant effect on mortality.
This will reduce the heterogeneity of each group, so that we can at
least observe groups with similar, but not the same, characteristics.
(b)
Sub-dividing data using many factors can result in the numbers in each
class being too low.
It is necessary to strike a balance between homogeneity of the group
and retaining a large enough group to make statistical analysis
possible.
Sufficient data may not be collected to allow sub-division.
This may be because marketing pressures mean proposal forms are
kept to a minimum.
