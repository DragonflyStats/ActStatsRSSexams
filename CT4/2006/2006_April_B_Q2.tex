A savings provider offers a regular premium pension contract, under which the customer is able to cease paying in premiums and restart them at a later date. In order
to profit test the product, the provider set up the four-state Markov model shown in the following diagram:

A motor insurer s No Claims Discount system uses the following levels of discount
{0%, 25%, 40%, 50%}. Following a claim free year a policyholder moves up one
discount level (or remains on 50% discount). If the policyholder makes one (or more)
claims in a year they move down one level (or remain at 0% discount).
The insurer estimates that the probability of making at least one claim in a year is 0.1
if the policyholder made no claims the previous year, and 0.25 if they made a claim
the previous year.
New policyholders should be ignored.

103 Solutions
A1
(a)
For a process to be strictly stationary, the joint distribution of X t 1 , X t 2 ,..., X t n
and X t
t 1 , X t t 2 ,..., X t t n
are identical for all t , t 1 , t 2 ,..., t n in J and all integers
n.
This means that the statistical properties of the process remain unchanged over
time.
(b)
Because strict stationarity is difficult to test fully in real life, we also use the
less stringent condition of weak stationarity.
Weak stationarity requires that the mean of the process, E[X t ] = m(t), is
constant and the covariance, E[(X s - m(s)) (X t - m(t))], depends only on the
time difference t s.
