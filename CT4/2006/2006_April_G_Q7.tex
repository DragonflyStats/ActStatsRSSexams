3 H ]
where
h ( t ) is the estimated hazard,
h 0 ( t ) is the baseline hazard,
F is a variable taking the value 1 if the life is female, and 0 otherwise,
M is a variable taking the value 1 if the life has medium self-
esteem and 0 otherwise,
H is a variable taking the value 1 if the life has high self-esteem and 0 otherwise,
