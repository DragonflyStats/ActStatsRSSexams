\begin{enumerate}
\item 
(i) Show that for continuous random variables X and Y:
E[Y] = E[E(Y|X)].
\item (ii)
Suppose that a random variable X has a standard normal distribution, and the
conditional distribution of a Poisson random variable Y, given the value of
X = x, has expectation $g(x) = X^{2} + 1$.
Determine E[Y] and Var[Y].
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\begin{eqnarray*}
E [ E ( Y | X )] &=& \int E [ Y | X = x ] f ( x ) dx\\
&=& \int \int yf ( y | x ) dy f ( x ) dx\\
&=& \int \int y f ( y | x ) f ( x ) dydx\\
\end{eqnarray*}

but $f ( y | x ) f ( x ) = f ( x , y )$, the joint pdf of X and Y , so
\[E [ E ( Y | X )] = \int \int y f ( x , y ) dxdy = E [ Y ]\]
(ii)
\begin{eqnarray*}
E [ Y ] &=& E [ E ( Y | X )] \\ 
&=& E [ X^{2} + 1] \\
&=& V [ X ] + { E [ X ]} 2 + 1 \\
&=& 1 + 0 + 1 \\ &=& 2
\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
Var [ Y ] &=& Var [ E ( Y | X )] + E [ Var ( Y | X )] \\ 
&=& Var [ X^{2} + 1] + E [ X^{2} + 1]\\
&=& Var [ X^{2} ] + E [ X^{2} ] + 1\\
\end{eqnarray*}

but Z = X^{2} is χ 1 2 so has variance 2 and expectation 1
Thus $Var [ Y ] = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4$
