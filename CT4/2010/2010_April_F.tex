\item (i)
State three different methods of graduating raw mortality data and
for each method give an example of a situation wheN_the method would be
appropriate.
 
A life insurance company last priced its whole of life contract 30 years ago using a
standard mortality table. The company wishes to establish whether recent mortality
experience iN_the portfolio of business is in line with the pricing basis. These are the
data:

By reference to a standard table – appropriate if data are scanty or a table of
similar lives exists.
Graphical graduation – appropriate if a “quick and dirty” result needed OR
for scanty data where no other method is appropriate

The null hypothesis is that the data come from a population where the
mortalitY_is that represented by the standard table.
The test statistic
∑
( O − E ) 2
E
is distributed \chi^2 .
There are 10 age groups.
No degrees of freedom lost for choice of table, parameters or constraints on
data.
So we use 10 degrees of freedom.
This is a one-tailed test.
The upper 5\% point of the \chi^2 with 10 degrees of freedom is 18.31.
The observed test statistic is 3.84.
Since 3.84 < 18.31.
We have insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
\item (iii)
ALTERNATIVE 1
(a) The data easily pass the chi squared test, but there does seem to be a
gradual drift of ( O – E ) figures from strongly positive to strongly
negative. I would do a grouping of signs test to see if the data
display runs or “clumps” of deviations of the same sign.
(b) G = Number of groups of positive z s = 1
m = number of deviations = 10
n 1 = number of positive deviations = 5
n 2 = number of negative deviations = 5
THEN EITHER
We want k * the largest k such that
⎛ n 1 − 1 ⎞⎛ n 2 + 1 ⎞
k ⎜
⎟⎜
⎟
⎝ t − 1 ⎠⎝ t ⎠
⎛ m ⎞
t = 1
⎜ ⎟
⎝ n 1 ⎠
∑
< 0.05
The test fails at the 5\% level if G \leq k *.
From the Gold Book k * = 1, so we reject the null hypothesis.
Page 21 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5— Examiners’ Report
OR
For t = 1
⎛ m ⎞ ⎛ 10 ⎞
⎛ n 1 − 1 ⎞ ⎛ 4 ⎞
⎛ n 2 + 1 ⎞ ⎛ 6 ⎞
⎜
⎟ = ⎜ ⎟ = 1 and ⎜
⎟ = ⎜ ⎟ = 6 and ⎜ n ⎟ = ⎜ ⎟ = 252
⎝ t − 1 ⎠ ⎝ 0 ⎠
⎝ t ⎠ ⎝ 1 ⎠
⎝ 1 ⎠ ⎝ 5 ⎠
So Pr[ t = 1] if the null hypothesis is true is 6/252 = 0.0238, which is less than
5\% so we reject the null hypothesis.
ALTERNATIVE 2
(a) The data easily pass the chi squared test, but there does seem to be
a gradual drift of ( O – E ) figures from strongly positive to strongly
negative. I would do a serial correlatioN_test to see if the data displays
runs or clumps” of deviations of the same sign.

Test 0.629 (9 0.5 ) = 1.887 against Normal (0,1), and, since
0.629 (9 0.5 ) = 1.887 > 1.645, we reject the null hypothesis.
ALTERNATIVE 3
Page 22
(a) Do the signs test to detect overall bias.
(b) Under the null hypothesis, the number of positive signs
amongst the z x s is distributed Binomial (10, 1⁄2 ). %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5— Examiners’ Report
We observe 5 positive signs.
The probability of obtaining 5 or more positive signs is 0.623
OR
The probability of obtaining exactly 5 positive signs is 0.246
Since this is greater than 0.025 (two-tailed test), we cannot reject the
null hypothesis.
Note that because this test is not really appropriate in a case where there are five negative
and five positive deviations, no marks were awarded for part (a) to candidates who chose the
Signs Test unless earlier errors meant that the number of negative and positive signs were
unequal.

So the value of the test statistic is

= 0.09846 .
269.38
Using a 5\% level of significance,
we see that $− 1.96 < 0.09846 < 1.96$.
We do not reject the null hypothesis.
Page 23 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5— Examiners’ Report
ALTERNATIVE 5
(a) To check for outliers we do the individual standardised
deviations test.
(b) If the standard table rates were the true rates underlying the
observed rates
we would expect the individual deviations to be distributed Normal
(0,1)
and therefore only 1 in 20 z x s should have absolute magnitudes
greater than 1.96
OR
none should lie outside the range $(–3, +3)$
OR
or diagram showing split of deviations actual versus expected.
Looking at the z x s we see that the largest individual deviation
is 1.373.
Since this is less in absolute magnitude than 1.96 we cannot reject the
null hypothesis.
In part (ii) credit was only given for the null hypothesis if the wording used by the candidate
indicates that (s)he understands that it is the mortality underlying the observed data that is
not significantly different from that iN_the standard table, or that the standard table
“represents” the mortalitY_iN_the observed data. The null hypothesis is not that the mortality
iN_the observed data is the same as that iN_the standard table – as it will normally not be.
