For both of the following sets of four stochastic processes, place each process in a
separate cell of the following table, so that each cell correctly describes the state space
and the time space of the process placed in it. Within each set, all four processes
should be placed in the table.

This question was answered well, with many candidates scoring full marks. Some candidates
lost marks by failing to follow the instructions in the question precisely. To obtain full credit,
candidates were required to place the processes in grids like those shown above with ONE
process in each of the four cells. What is shown above is the only solution which fulfils this
criterion for groups (a) and (b). In some cases, processes could correctly be placed in cells
other than those shown in the grids above, and credit was given for each process thus
classified correctly.
