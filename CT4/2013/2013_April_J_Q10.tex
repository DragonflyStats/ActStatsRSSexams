An insurance company has a portfolio of building insurance policies. The company
classifies buildings into three types and believes that the number of claims on
buildings of each type follows a Poisson distribution with parameters as shown:
Type Parameter
1
2
3 λ
2λ
5 λ
where λ is an unknown positive constant.
Actual claim numbers over the last five years have been as follows. Here X ij
represents the number of claims from the ith type in the jth year:
Number of claims X ij

(i) Derive the maximum likelihood estimate of λ . [5]
(ii) Estimate the average number of claims per year for each type of building
using EBCT Model 1. [7]
(iii) Comment on the results of parts (i) and (ii). [2]
(iv) Explain the main weakness of the model in part (ii).

(i)
The future development of the process depends only on the state currently occupied
and not on any previous history.
OR
\[P [ X t \in A ⏐ X s 1 = x 1 , X s 2 = x 2 , ..., X s n = x n , X s = x ] = P [ X t \in A ⏐ X s = x ]\]
for all times s 1 < s 2 < ... < s n < s < t , all states x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n , x in S and all subsets A of
S.
(ii)
Condition on the state occupied at x + t , using the Markov assumption:

p 12
x = t p x dt p x + t + t p x dt p x + t
But by Law of Total Probability dt p x 22 + t = 1 − dt p x 21 + t , so

x = t p x dt p x + t + t p x (1 − dt p x + t ) .

Now, since by assumption, for small dt ,
o ( dt )
where lim

dt → 0 dt

p ij x + t = \mu ij x + t dt + o ( dt ) ,
we can substitute to give

x = t p x \mu x + t dt + t p x (1 − \mu x + t dt ) + o ( dt )

x − t p x = t p x \mu x + t dt − t p x \mu x + t dt + o ( dt ) .

In part (ii) minor variations on the exact derivation given above were permitted, but all the
steps were required for full credit. In part (iii) some candidates attempted a solution using
integral equations. A relatively common example argued that the required probability could
be obtained from:

0 0 0

− 0.2 w
.0.2. e − 0.8(3 − w ) dw = 0.2 ∫ e − 2.4 e 0.6 w dw = 0.2 e − 2.4 ∫ e 0.6 w dw .
3 p 0 = ∫ e
Evaluating this integral produces 3 p 0 12 =
0.2 − 2.4 0.6 w 3 0.2 − 0.6 − 2.4

This is incorrect as it ignores the possibility that lives might oscillate between states 1and 2
between t = 0 and t = 3. It only considers those lives who move between states 1 and 2 with
exactly one transition and do not return to state 1. However, this alternative shows
considerable understanding of the process, and was given some credit.
