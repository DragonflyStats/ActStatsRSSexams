\noindent The Shining Light company has developed a new type of light bulb which it recently tested. 1,000 bulbs were switched on and observed until they failed, or until 500 hours had elapsed. For each bulb that failed, the duration in hours until failure was noted. Due to an earth tremor after 200 hours, 200 bulbs shattered and had to be removed from the test before failure. The results showed that 
\begin{itemize}
\item 10 bulbs failed after 50 hours, 
\item d20 bulbs failed after 100 hours,
\item 50 bulbs failed after 250 hours, 
\item 300 bulbs failed after 400 hours,
\item 50 bulbs failed after 450 hours.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item (i) Calculate the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function, $S(t)$, for the light
bulbs in the test.
\item
(ii) Sketch the Kaplan-Meier estimate calculated in part (i).
\item 
(iii) Estimate the probability that a bulb will not have failed after each of the
following durations: 300 hours, 400 hours and 600 hours. If it is not possible
to obtain an estimate for any of the durations without additional assumptions,
explain why.
\end{enumerate}

S(300) = 0.9070.
S(400) = 0.5291.
S(600) cannot be estimated without additional assumptions
as it lies outside the range of our data.

%% -- [Total 11]
This question was very well answered, with many candidates scoring 10 or more marks out of a possible 11. Some of the sketches in part (ii) were very scrappy and were penalised:
though great accuracy was not required, the sketch did need to be sufficiently clear to demonstrate that the candidate understood the nature of the function being plotted. In part (iii) some candidates suggested an assumption which would enable them to give an answer
for S(600). Such candidates were given full credit provided they explained why the assumption was needed, and provided that the stated assumption was consistent with the numerical answer offered.
