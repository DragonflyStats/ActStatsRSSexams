Markov chain.

Q1
(a) Not a valid transition matrix,
because the first row sums to 0 not 1. 

(b) Not a valid transition matrix,
because it is not square. 

(c) This is a valid transition matrix. 
Each row sums to one, and each entry is between 0 and 1
inclusive, and the matrix is square. 
(d)
Not a valid transition matrix,
because there is an entry which is less than 0.


[Total 4]
Most candidates answered this question well. The most common
error was not to recognise that transition matrices for a Markov
chain must be square.
