CT4 A2011—410
At Miracle Cure hospital a pioneering new surgery was tested to replace human lungs with synthetic implants. Operations were carried out throughout June 2010. Patients who underwent the surgery were monitored daily until the end of August 2010, or until they died or left hospital if sooner. The results are shown below. Where no date is given, the patient was alive and still in hospital at the end of August.

An historian has investigated the force of mortality from tuberculosis in a particular town in a developed country in the 1860s using a sample of records from a cemetery. He wishes to test whether the underlying mortality from tuberculosis in the town is
the same as the national force of mortality from this cause of death, as reported in death registration data. The data are shown in the table below.

Question 10
(i)
Right censoring is present
for those still alive and in hospital at the end of August
OR
for those who left hospital while still alive
Left censoring is not present
The censoring is likely to be informative, since those leaving hospital are likely to be in much better health than those who remain. (The idea of going home to die when you have had a lung transplant is a little tenuous.)

The probability of death within 4 weeks is 1 – S(28) = 0.2143.
In part (i) candidates could receive credit for saying that left censoring was present IF they gave a valid reason (which typically involved the imprecise measurement of the times of surgery or of events – the left censoring arising as a special case of interval censoring).
In part (ii) each error was only penalised once. Correct calculations which carried forward earlier errors were given full credit. However, candidates who did not list the durations they were using, but then presented incorrect estimates of the survival function, were more heavily penalised, as it was not clear how many errors they had made.
In part (ii) candidates who assume that the death at duration 56 takes place after the
censoring at the same duration (ALTERNATIVE 2) were required to state this assumption for full credit. For ALTERNATIVE 1, the assumption that the death at duration 56 takes place before the censoring does not need to be stated for full credit, as it is the convention when
calculating Kaplan-Meier estimates.

In part (iii) the plotted function should be consistent with the answer to part (ii). If the answer to part (ii) was incorrect but the incorrect answer to part (ii) was correctly plotted in part (iii), full credit could be awarded to part (iii).
Question 11
(i)
The chi-squared test is a suitable overall test.
Let μ x be the force of mortality in age-group x in the sample.
Let μ x s be the force of mortality in age group x in the national population.
Let E x c be the central exposed to risk in the sample.
Then if z x =
E x c μ x − E x c μ s x
E x c μ s x
the test statistic is
∑ z x 2 ∼ χ 2 m ,
x
THEN EITHER
where m is the number of age groups, which in this case is 8.
The calculations are shown below.

Therefore the value of the test statistic is 5.1742.
The critical value of the chi-squared distribution at the 5% level of significance with 8
degrees of freedom is 15.51.
Since 5.1742 < 15.51 we do not reject the null hypothesis that the mortality rate from tuberculosis in the sample is the same as that in the national population.

The critical value of the chi-squared distribution at the 5\% level of significance with 7

(b)
Signs test
Under the null hypothesis that the mortality rate from tuberculosis in the sample is the same as that in the national population,
the number of positive signs is distributed Binomial (m, 0.5), where m is the number of ages.
We have 1 positive sign.
The probability of 1 or fewer positive signs is given by
⎛ 8 ⎞ 8 ⎛ 8 ⎞ 8
⎜ ⎟ 0.5 + ⎜ ⎟ 0.5 = 0.0352 .

⎛ 7 ⎞ 7 ⎛ 7 ⎞ 7
⎜ ⎟ 0.5 + ⎜ ⎟ 0.5 = 0.0625 .
⎝ 0 ⎠
⎝ 1 ⎠
We use a two-tailed test (since too few or too many positive signs would be a
problem)
so we reject the null hypothesis if the probability of 1 or fewer positive signs
is less than 0.025.
Since 0.0352 (or 0.0625) > 0.025
we do not reject the null hypothesis.

We do not reject the null hypothesis.
(a) Individual ages at which there are unusually large differences between the sample and the national experience.
(b) Individual standardised deviations
Under the null hypothesis that the mortality rate from tuberculosis in the sample is the same as that in the national population

that the mortality rate from tuberculosis in the sample is the same as that in the national population
(iii)
In none of the tests we have performed do we reject the null hypothesis.
Therefore it seems that the mortality from tuberculosis in the town is the same as the national force of mortality.
In part (ii) the null hypothesis should be stated somewhere for each test. It could be stated at
the beginning, or in the conclusion. As long as it is correctly stated somewhere, full credit was given. In part (iii), the comment should be consistent with the results of the tests performed in parts (i) and (ii) to gain credit.
Most candidates made a good attempt at part (i). Attempts at part (ii) were more varied. In particular, most candidates did not point out that the chi-squared test only fails to detect SMALL (but consistent) bias. If the bias is large and consistent, the chi-squared test will
detect it.
