(i) Define a Markov jump process.

[Total 9]

A study of a tropical disease used a three-state Markov process model with states:
\begin{description}
\item[1.] Not suffering from the disease
\item[2.] Suffering from the disease
\item[3.] Dead
\end{description}
The disease can be fatal, but most sufferers recover. Let t p ij x be the probability that a
person in state i at age x is in state j at age x+t. Let $\mu ijx + t$ be the transition intensity
from state i to state j at age x+t.
(ii)
Show from first principles that:
d 13
11 13
12 23
t p x = t p x \mu x + t + t p x \mu x + t .
dt

The study revealed that sufferers who contract the disease a second or subsequent
time are more likely to die, and less likely to recover, than first-time sufferers.
(iii)
Draw a diagram showing the states and possible transitions of a model which
allows for this effect yet retains the Markov property.
\newpage  Question 9
(i)
A Markov jump process is a continuous time, discrete state process
THEN EITHER
in which, given the present state of the process, additional knowledge of the past is
irrelevant for the calculation of the probability distribution of future values of the
process.
OR
\[P [ X t \in  A | X s 1 = x 1 , X s 2 = x 2 ,..., X s n = x n ] = P [ X t \in  A | X s = x ]\]
for all times s 1 < s 2 < ... < s n < s < t , all states $x 1 , x 2 ,..., x n$ , $x \in S$ and all subsets A of S.
(ii)
Using the Markov property, and conditioning on the state occupied
at age x + t, we have
t + dt

x = t p x dt p x + t + t p x dt p x + t + t p x dt p x + t

Substituting for the dt p ij x + t in the equation above, and noting that
since return from the state “Dead” is impossible, produces

p 13
x = t p x \mu x + t dt + t p x \mu x + t dt + t p x + o ( dt )

p 13
x − t p x = t p x \mu x + t dt + t p x \mu x + t dt + o ( dt )

t + dt

t p x = t p x \mu x + t + t p x \mu x + t .

%This question was fairly well answered, though many candidates omitted the initial point in
%part (ii), that we need the Markov property to be able to condition on the state occupied at
%x+t. A common error in part (iii) was a four-state solution with the states “1 – Never having
%suffered from the disease”, “2 – Suffering from the disease”, “3 – Dead”, and “4 –
%Recovered”. This is not correct, as the probability of moving from the state “Suffering from
%the disease” to the state “Dead” depends on whether the person is suffering from the disease
for the first time or the second or subsequent time.
12Subject CT4 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% — Examiners’ Report, April 2011
In part (iii) both alternatives were accepted. The second allows for the possibility that the
effect of contracting the disease for the second time in raising the risk of death persists even
after the patient recovers from the second or subsequent attack.
