An investigation was carried out into the relationship between sickness and mortality
in an historical population of working class men. The investigation used a three-state
model with the states:
1
2
3
Healthy
Sick
Dead
Let the probability that a person in state i at time x will be in state j at time x+t be
ij
ij
t p x . Let the transition intensity at time x+t between any two states i and j be μ x + t .
(i) Draw a diagram showing the three states and the possible transitions between
them.
[2]
(ii) Show from first principles that
∂

t p x = t p x μ x + t + t p x μ x + t .
∂ t
(iii)
[5]
Write down the likelihood of the data in the investigation in terms of the
transition rates and the waiting times in the Healthy and Sick states, under the
assumption that the transition rates are constant.
[3]
The investigation collected the following data:
•
•
•
•
man-years in Healthy state
man-years in Sick state
number of transitions from Healthy to Sick
number of transitions from Sick to Dead
265
140
20
40
(iv) Derive the maximum likelihood estimator of the transition rate from Sick to
Dead.
[3]
(v) Hence estimate:
(a)
(b)
the value of the constant transition rate from Sick to Dead
95 per cent confidence intervals around this transition rate
