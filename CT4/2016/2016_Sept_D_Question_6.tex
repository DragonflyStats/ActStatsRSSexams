Brian worked in a large open-plan office with a communal kitchen in which the
workers made coffee. Each worker supplied his or her own coffee cup. For several
years Brian was annoyed by his coffee cups being taken away by colleagues and
never returned to the kitchen, so he decided to do an experiment. He brought into the
kitchen 20 cups which were distinguishable from the other cups in the kitchen. At the
end of each day for 15 days he counted the number of his 20 cups which remained.
The results were as follows:

Brian noted that:
x the cup that “disappeared” during day 2 was taken home by Brian to be used by
his mother.
x the two cups that “disappeared” during day 13 were accidentally broken by Brian
when doing his daily check.
Let h(x) be the hazard that each of Brian’s cups is taken by colleagues during day x
and not returned, and let S(x) be the corresponding survival function.

Many candidates scored highly on this straightforward application of the
Nelson-Aalen estimator of the survival function. Some candidates assumed
that events happened at the beginning of each day rather than the end.
These candidates could score full credit (the only change to the solution
above is that the t j s for the events should be 2, 4, 7, 8, 13 and 14). A
common error was to quote the estimated S(t) for a duration more than 15
days. This is incorrect because we have no information about what happened
after 15 days.
