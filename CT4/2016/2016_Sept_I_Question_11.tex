An individual’s marginal tax rate depends upon his or her total income during a
calendar year and may be 0% (that is, he or she is a non-taxpayer), 20% or 40%.
The movement in the individual’s marginal tax rate from year to year is believed to
follow a Markov Chain with a transition matrix as follows:
0% § 1  E  E 2

We require each row of the transition matrix to sum to 1. 
Here this holds for all values of \beta . 
We require each of the following to lie between 0 and 1 inclusive:
\beta , \beta 2 , 2 \beta ,1 − 3 \beta ,1 − \beta − \beta 2 .
The first two require that 0 \leq \beta \leq 1 . 
The third requires that 0 \leq \beta \leq 1/ 2 .

The fourth that \beta \leq , \beta ≥ 0 .

The fifth implies \beta \leq

(iii)
If \beta > 0 then it can reach any other state (so it is irreducible) [1]
and it has a loop on each state (so it is aperiodic). 
However if \beta = 0 it can never leave its current state so it is reducible.

The stationary distribution satisfies π = π P . 
We have:
π 0 = 0.89 π 0 + 0.1 π 20 + 0.01 π 40
π 20 = 0.1 π 0 + 0.7 π 20 + 0.1 π 40

π 40 = 0.01 π 0 + 0.2 π 20 + 0.89 π 40
and
π 0 + π 20 + π 40 = 1 .

The first and third equations give

This question was generally well answered, except for part (ii). In part (ii) a
large number of candidates considered that \beta could not take the values 0 and
1, even though it was a probability. In part (ii) candidates who gave the
correct range of 0 \leq \beta \leq 1/3 scored 2 marks. The other mark was for
reasoning leading to the correct range. Candidates who gave an incorrect
range could score partial credit for sensible reasoning. The most common
error in part (iv) was to base the answer on P 3 rather than P 2 .
