9 A certain town runs a training course for traffic wardens each year. The course lasts
for 30 days, but the examination which enables someone to qualify as a traffic warden
can be sat any day during the course. In 2011 there were 13 participants who started
the training course. The following table has been compiled to show the day each
candidate qualified or the day each candidate who did not qualify left the course.
