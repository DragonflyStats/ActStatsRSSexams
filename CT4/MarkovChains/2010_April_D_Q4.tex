\noindent A Markov Chain with state space {A, B, C} has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item it is irreducible
\item it is periodic
\item the probability of moving from A to B equals the probability of moving from A
to C
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  Show that these properties uniquely define the process.
\item  Sketch a transition diagram for the process.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item As periodic and irreducible then all states are periodic, hence
probability of staying in any state is zero.
\item By law of total probability, $P_{AA}$ + $P_{AB}$ + $P_{AC}$ = 1.
\item But $P_{AB}$ = $P_{AC}$ and $P_{AA}$ = 0 so $P_{AB}$ = $P_{AC}$ = 0.5.
\item To be irreducible at least one of $P_{BA}$ or $P_{CA}$ must be greater than zero.
\item If $P_{BA}$ $> 0$ then to be periodic must have $P_{CB}$ = 0,
and to be irreducible $P_{CA}$ $> 0$,
and if $P_{CA}$ $> 0$ then to be periodic must have $P_{BC}$ = 0, and to be
irreducible $P_{BA}$ $> 0$.
\item So must have $P_{BC}$ = $P_{CB}$ = 0 and $P_{BA}$ = $P_{CA}$ = 1.
