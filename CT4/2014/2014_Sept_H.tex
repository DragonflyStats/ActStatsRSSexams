\begin{document}9 A life insurance company is developing a new class of annuity business. It has
conducted a study of mortality among lives it believes represent this new business. It
wishes to graduate the data so that they are suitable for use in financial calculations.
It decides to use a standard table as a basis for graduation and the function:
s 0.01
μx = μx + 􀁄
where x μ
􀁄
are the graduated rates and s
μx are the rates from the standard table.
The table below gives some results from the graduation.

The observed test statistic is 12.295
The number of age groups is 10, but we lose some degrees of freedom
because of the process of graduation
one for the parameter of the function linking the graduated rates to the
standard table rates, and at least one more for the choice of standard table, so
m = 7 or 8, say.

The critical value of the chi-squared distribution with 7 degrees of

freedom at the 5\% level is 14.07, and with 8 degrees of freedom is 15.51.
Since 12.295 < 14.07 (or 15.51)
we do not reject the null hypothesis at the 95\% confidence level. [6]
(ii) 
\begin{itemize}
    \item There may be one or two large deviations at individual ages, the effect of
which are insufficient to raise the chi-squared value above the critical level.
\item Small but consistent bias across the whole of the age range.
\item The graduation might be the wrong shape, in that the graduated rates might be
higher than the crude rates in one part of the age range, and systematically
lower in another part of the age range.
\item This will lead to runs or clumps of
deviations of the same sign.
\end{itemize}
The rates may not progress smoothly from age to age.
[Only three of these were required for full credit] [3]
(iii) Large deviations
For large deviations, use the Individual Standardised Deviations test.
The null hypothesis is the same as in part (i), that the graduated rates are the
true underlying rates for the new class of business.
We would expect the individual deviations to be distributed Normal (0,1)
and therefore only 1 in 20 zxs should have absolute magnitude greater than
1.96 (or none should be outside 3 to +3)
OR table showing split of deviations, actual versus expected
as below
Range –∞,–2 –2,–1 –1,0 0,1 1,2 2,+∞
Expected 0.2 1.4 3.4 3.4 1.4 0.2
Actual 0 1 2 5 1 1
\begin{itemize}
    \item Looking at the zxs we see that the largest one is 2.24 and the next is 1.57.
\item This test is therefore inconclusive (1 deviation out of 10 ages is greater
than 1.96).
\item Small but consistent bias
\item For small but consistent bias use the Signs test or the Cumulative Deviations
test.

\item The null hypothesis is the same as in part (i), that the graduated rates are the
true underlying rates for the new class of business.
\end{itemize}

EITHER SIGNS TEST
Under the null hypothesis, the number of positive signs amongst the zx is
distributed Binomial (10, ½ )
We observe 7 positive signs.
The probability of observing 7 or more positive signs in 10 observations is
0.1719
OR
the probability of observing exactly 7 positive signs is 0.1172.
either of which implies that Pr[observing 6 or more] > 0.025 (a two-tailed
test),
so we have no evidence to reject the null hypothesis
OR CUMULATIVE DEVIATIONS TEST
Under the null hypothesis

So, using the results in the table in the solution to part (a) the value of the test
statistic is
294 274.75 1.16
274.75


Since –1.96 < test statistic < +1.96
we have insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
Shape of graduation/runs or clumps
For the existence of runs or clumps of deviations of the same sign, we use the
Grouping of Signs test or the Serial Correlations Test
The null hypothesis is the same as before, that the graduated rates are the true
underlying rates for the new class of business.
%%Subject CT4 (Models Core Technical) – September 2014 – Examiners’ Report Page 21
EITHER GROUPING OF SIGNS TEST
\begin{itemize}
    \item G = Number of groups of positive deviations = 1
    \item m = number of deviations = 10
    \item n1 = number of positive deviations = 7
    \item n2 = number of negative deviations = 3
\end{itemize}

THEN EITHER
We want k* the largest k such that

From the Gold Book k* = 1, so we reject the null hypothesis.

So Pr[t = 1] if the null hypothesis is true is

Page 22
Test 0.706 (√10) = 2.232 against Normal (0,1), and, since
2.232 > +1.645, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis (NB
one-sided test)

test.

These should be small in magnitude compared with the rates themselves and
progress regularly which does not seem to be the case here.
So we conclude that the graduated rates are not sufficiently smooth. [6]
(iv) Although the overall fit of the graduated rates to the crude rates is
acceptable,
EITHER
The result of the grouping of signs/serial correlation test suggests that the
graduated rates are the wrong shape: too high at younger ages and too low at
older ages.
OR
The results of the individual standardised deviation test indicate that there
might be an outlier at age 76
The graduation should be carried out again with either a different standard
table or a different link functions
It seems a multiplicative function such as s
x  ax  might be better than just
adding a constant to the s
x s.

IF SMOOTHNESS TEST NOT DONE
The graduated rates should be sufficiently smooth to use for financial
calculations.
OR, IF SMOOTHNESS TEST DONE
The graduated rates do not seem to be especially smooth.
Because the shape of the graduated rates seems incorrect, the company
would be unwise to use these rates for financial calculations. [2]

% In part (i) the null hypothesis was often vaguely expressed. Statements that the graduated rates are “a good fit”, “consistent with”, “similar to” or “representative of” the underlying rates were not given full credit. In part (iii) it was acceptable if candidates did not use whole numbers of actual deaths but obtained the actual deaths as the result of multiplying the (rounded) crude rates by the exposed to risk. In part (iii) the null hypothesis should be stated for each test, but candidates could obtain credit by a statement that the null hypotheses for each test are the same as than in part (i). To obtain credit, the comments in part (iv) had to reflect the tests actually carried out by the candidate. Many candidates scored highly on parts (i) and (ii). Performance on part (iii) was less convincing. In part (iv) few candidates made comments beyond noting the immediate implications of the test results (i.e. that although the overall fit is satisfactory the graduation failed the Grouping of Signs test or that there was “clumping of signs”).
