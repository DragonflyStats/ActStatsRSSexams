%%- Question 4 
\begin{itemize} 
\item[(i)] Define the force of mortality, $\mu x+t$ of a random variable $T$ denoting length of
life. 
\end{itemize}
The mortality of a certain species of animal has been studied. It is known that at ages
under five years the force of mortality, $\mu$, is constant.
\begin{itemize} 
\item[(ii)] Write down an expression, in terms of $\mu$, for the probability that an animal
will survive from birth to exact age five years. 
\end{itemize}

Mortality of these animals at ages over five years exact is incompletely understood.
However it is known that the probability that an animal aged exactly five years will
survive until exact age 10 years is twice the probability that an animal aged exactly
five years will survive until exact age 20 years.
Assume that the force of mortality, $\lambda$, is constant at ages over five years exact.
\begin{itemize} 
\item[(iii)] Calculate $\lambda$. 
\item[(iv)] Calculate the expectation of life at birth for these animals if $\lambda = \mu$. 
\item[(v)] Derive an expression, in terms only of $\mu$, for the expectation of life at birth for
these animals if $\lambda â‰  \mu$, 
\end{itemize}
